  <h2 class='c007'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The preparation of this book has been a joint labor during the spare
moments of the two authors, whose time has been occupied with subjects
to which pearls are not wholly foreign—one as a gem expert, and
the other in the fisheries branch of the American government. But
for the views and expressions contained herein, they alone are personally
responsible, and do not represent or speak for any interest
whatever. For many years the writers have collected data on the
subject of pearls, and have accumulated all the obtainable literature,
not only the easily procurable books, but likewise manuscripts, copies
of rare volumes, original edicts, and legislative enactments, thousands
of newspaper clippings, and interesting illustrations, many of them
unique, making probably the largest single collection of data in existence
on this particular subject. It was deemed advisable to present the
results of these studies and observations in one harmonious volume,
rather than in two different publications. This publication is not a
pioneer in an untrodden field. As may be seen from the appended
bibliography, during the last two thousand years hundreds of persons
have discussed pearls—mystically, historically, poetically, and learnedly.
Among the older writers who stand out with special prominence
in their respective periods are the encyclopedist Pliny, in the first century
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>; Oviedo and Peter Martyr of the sixteenth century; the
physician Anselmus De Boot, and that observant traveler and prince
of jewelers, Tavernier, in the seventeenth century. It would be difficult
to do justice to the many writers of the nineteenth century and of the
present time; but probably most attention has been attracted by the
writings of Hessling and Möbius of Germany; Kelaart, Streeter,
Herdman, and Hornell of Great Britain; Filippi of Italy, and Seurat
and Dubois of France. While the book is a joint work in the sense
that each writer has contributed material to all of the chapters and
has critically examined and approved the entire work, the senior author
has more closely applied himself to the latter half of the text, covering
antiquity values, commerce, wearing manipulation, treatment, famous
collections, aboriginal use, and the illustrations, while the junior
author has attended to the earlier half of the book, with reference to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>history, origin, sources, fisheries, culture, mystical properties, and the
literature of the pearl.</p>

<p class='c013'>The senior author has had exceptionally favorable opportunities to
examine the precious objects contained in the various imperial and
royal treasuries. Through the courtesy of the late Count Sipuigine,
Court Chamberlain, and of the late General Philamanoff, custodian of
the Ourejena Palata, he was permitted to critically examine the Russian
crown jewels in the Summer Palace on the Neva, and in the
Palata in the Kremlin, at Moscow, he examined the crowns and
jewels of all the early czars. Through the courtesy of Baron von
Theile, he was permitted to inspect carefully and in detail the wonderful
jewels of the Austrian crown, which are beautifully ordered
and arranged. The English and Saxon crown jewels were also seen
under favorable conditions which permitted detailed examination, and
the jewel collections of almost all the principal museums of Europe
and America were carefully studied. As regards the literature of the
subject, the senior author has gathered together the largest known
existing collection of works treating of pearls and precious stones.</p>

<p class='c013'>In covering so comprehensive a subject, many obligations have been
incurred from individuals and officials, to whose courtesy and assistance
is due much of the interest of this work. To list all of these is
impossible, yet it would be ungrateful not to note the following: her

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>Perfected by nature and requiring no art to enhance their
beauty, pearls were naturally the earliest gems known to
prehistoric man. Probably the members of some fish-eating
tribe—maybe of the coast of India or bordering an Asiatic
river—while opening mollusks for food, were attracted by their luster.
And as man’s estimation of beauty developed, he found in them the
means of satisfying that fondness for personal decoration so characteristic
of half-naked savages, which has its counterpart amid the
wealth and fashion of the present day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls seem to be peculiarly suggestive of oriental luxury and
magnificence. It is in the East that they have been especially loved,
enhancing the charms of Asiatic beauty and adding splendor to barbaric
courts celebrated for their display of costume. From their possession
of the rich pearl resources it is natural that the people of India
and of Persia should have early found beauty and value in these jewels,
and should have been among the first to collect them in large quantities.
And no oriental divinity, no object of veneration has been without
this ornament; no poetical production has lacked this symbol of
purity and chastity.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a personal memorandum, Dr. A. V. Williams Jackson, professor
of Indo-Iranian languages in Columbia University, states that it is
generally supposed that the Vedas, the oldest sacred books of the Brahmans,
contain several allusions to pearl decorations a millennium or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>more before the Christian era, as the word <i>krisana</i> and its derivatives—which
occur a half dozen times in the Rigveda, the oldest of the
Vedas—are generally translated as signifying “pearl.” Even if this
interpretation of the term be called into question on the ground that
the Hindus of the Panjab were not well acquainted with the sea, there
can be little or no doubt that the Atharvaveda, at least five hundred
years before the Christian era, alludes to an amulet made of pearls and
used as a sort of talisman in a hymn<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a> of magic formulas.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those two great epics of ancient India, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata,
refer to pearls. The Ramayana speaks of a necklace of
twenty-seven pearls, and has pearl drillers to accompany a great military
expedition.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a> An old myth recounts the offerings made by the elements
as gifts worthy of the deity: the air offered the rainbow, the fire
a meteor, the earth a ruby, and the sea a pearl. The rainbow formed a
halo about the god, the meteor served as a lamp, the ruby decorated
the forehead, and the pearl was worn upon the heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>The literature of Hinduism frequently associates the pearl with
Krishna, the eighth avatar or incarnation of Vishnu, the most popular
god of Hindu worship. One legend credits its discovery to the adorable
Krishna, who drew it from the depths of the sea to adorn his
daughter Pandaïa on her nuptial day. Another version makes the
pearl a trophy of the victory of Krishna over the monster Pankagna,
and it was used by the victor as a decoration for his bride.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the classic period of Sanskrit literature, about the first century of
the Christian era, there were abundant references to pearls, generally
called <i>mukta</i> (literally “the pure”); and there are dozens of words for
pearl necklaces, circlets, strings, and ornamental festoons, particularly
in the dramas of Kalidasa—the Hindu Shakspere, who lived about the
third century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>—and of his successors.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Mahavansa and the Dipavansa, the ancient chronicle histories
of Ceylon in the Pali language, are several early Cingalese records
of pearl production and estimation.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c017'><sup>[3]</sup></a> The Mahavansa lists pearls
among the native products sent from Ceylon about 550 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, King
Wijayo sending his father-in-law gifts of pearls and chanks to the
value of two lacs of rupees; and notes that about 300 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, several
varieties of Ceylon pearls were carried as presents by an embassy to
India.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>In the ancient civilization of China, pearls were likewise esteemed;
this is evidenced by the frequent mention of them in traditional history,
their employment in the veneration of idols, and as tribute by
foreign princes to the emperor. One of the very earliest of books, the
Shu King (dating from about 2350–625 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), notes that, in the
twenty-third century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, Yü received as tribute oyster pearls from the
river Hwai, and from the province of King Kau he received “strings
of pearls that were not quite round.”<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c017'><sup>[4]</sup></a> That ancient Chinese dictionary,
the Nh’ya, originating thirty centuries ago, speaks of them as
precious jewels found in the province of Shen-si on the western
frontier.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many fantastic theories regarding pearls are to be found in ancient
Chinese literature. Some writers credited them as originating in
the brain of the fabled dragon; others noted that they were especially
abundant during the reign of illustrious emperors, and they were used
as amulets and charms against fire and other disasters. Curious allusions
were made to pearls so brilliant that they were visible at a distance
of nearly a thousand yards, or that rice could be cooked by the
light from them. And one found about the beginning of the Christian
era, near Yangchow-fu, in the province of Kiang-su, was reported so
lustrous as to be visible in the dark at a distance of three miles.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Persia, the popularity of pearls seems to date from a very early
period. Professor Jackson states that if they are not mentioned in the
extant fragments of the ancient Zoroastrian literature, the Avesta and
the Pahlavi, or by the Middle Persian books from the seventh century
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span> to the ninth century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, it is probably a mere accident, due to the
character of the work or to the fragmentary condition of the literature;
for pearls were well known during that entire period, and seem to be
indicated in extant sculptures. The coin and the gem portraits of
Persian queens commonly show ear-pendants of these. The remains
of a magnificent necklace of pearls and other gems were recently
found by J. de Morgan in the sarcophagus of an Achæmenid princess
exhumed at Susa or Shushan, the winter residence of the kings of
Persia. This necklace, perhaps the most ancient pearl ornament still
in existence, dates certainly from not later than the fourth century
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and is now preserved in the Persian Gallery of the Louvre.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c017'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Even
if we had no other evidence, it would be natural to assume that
the knowledge of pearls was as wide-spread among the Iranians in
antiquity as it was among the Hindus, since the Persian Gulf, like the
Indian Ocean, has been famous for its fisheries from ancient times.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the ruins of Babylon no pearls have been found; indeed, it would
be surprising if they could survive for so many ages in the relatively
moist soil which contains much saltpeter. Inlays of mother-of-pearl
and decorations of this material have been secured from the ruins of
Bismaya, which Dr. Edgar J. Banks refers to about 4500 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>There is likewise little evidence that pearls were extensively employed
by the ancient Assyrians, notwithstanding that excavations at
Nineveh and Nimrud have furnished much information regarding
their ornaments; and the collars, bracelets, sword-hilts, etc., wrought
in gold and ornamented with gems, show that the jewelers’ art had
made much progress. This is not wholly trustworthy as determining
the relative abundance; for being of organic or non-mineral origin,
pearls would not have survived the burial for thousands of years so
well as the crystal gems. An inscription on the Nineveh Obelisk,
which states, according to Sir Henry Rawlinson, that in the ninth year
of his reign Temenbar received, as “tribute of the kings of the Chaldees,
gold, silver, gems, and pearls,”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c017'><sup>[6]</sup></a> shows that the sea-born gems
were highly valued there.</p>

<p class='c013'>The mother-of-pearl shell was in use as an ornament in ancient
Egypt certainly as early as the sixth dynasty (<i>circa</i> 3200 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), the
period of the Tanis Sphinx. In a recent letter from Luxor, where he is
studying the ruins of ancient Thebes, Dr. James T. Dennis states that
he has found several of these shells bearing cartouches of that period;
and in the “pan-bearing graves” of the twelfth dynasty (2500 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>),
the shell occurred not only complete, but cut in roughly circular or oblong
angular blocks and strung on chains with beads of carnelian,
pottery, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>So far as can be determined from the representations of ancient
Egyptian costumes, pearls do not seem to have been employed to any
great extent in their decoration. The necklaces, earrings, and other
jewels found in the tombs, which are composed largely of gold set with
crystal gems, contain the remains of a few pearls, but give no indication
that they were numerous. In fact, no evidence exists that they
were used extensively before the Persian conquest in the fifth century
B.C.; and probably it was not until the time of the Ptolemies that there
began the lavish abundance which characterized the court of Alexandria
at the height of her power.</p>

<p class='c013'>The authorities differ in regard to the mention of pearls in ancient
Hebrew literature; although in the Authorized Version of the Old
Testament, this significance has been given to the word <i>gabîsh</i> in Job
xxviii. 18, where the value of wisdom is contrasted with that of
<i>gabîsh</i>. Some writers claim that this word refers to rock crystal.
Other authorities are of the opinion that the word <i>peninim</i> in Lam. iv.
7, which has been translated as “rubies,” actually signifies pearls. In
Gen. ii. 12, Prof. Paul Haupt has proposed to render <i>shoham</i> stones
by pearls, since the Hebrew word translated “onyx,” if connected with
the Assyrian <i>sându</i>, might mean “the gray gem.” It does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>appear that they entered into the decorations of the Tabernacle and
the Temple, or were largely employed in the paraphernalia of the
synagogue.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the New Testament, however, there are numerous references to
the estimation in which pearls were held. In his teachings, Christ
repeatedly referred to them as typifying something most precious:
“The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly
pearls: who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold
all that he had, and bought it” (Matt. xiii. 45, 46); and in “casting
pearls before swine,” in that great Sermon on the Mount (Matt. vii. 6).
In picturing the glories of the Heavenly City, St. John made the twelve
gates of pearls (Rev. xxi. 21); and what could better serve as portals
through the walls of precious stones?</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Talmud, pearls are frequently mentioned, and usually as
signifying something beautiful or very costly, as “a pearl that is worth
thousands of zuzim” (Baba Batra, 146a); a “pearl that has no price”
(Yerushalmi, ix. 12d); the coats which God made for Adam and Eve
were “as beautiful as pearls” (Gen. R. xx. 12), and the manna was
“as white as a pearl” (Yoma, 75a). Their purchase formed one of
the exceptions to the law of <i>Ona’ah</i> (overcharge), for the reason that
two matched pearls greatly exceeded the value of each one separately
(Baba Mezi’a, iv. 8).</p>

<p class='c013'>The high value attached to pearls by the ancient Hebrews is illustrated
by a beautiful Rabbinical story in which only one object in
nature is ranked above them. On approaching Egypt, Abraham hid
Sarah in a chest, that foreign eyes might not behold her beauty. When
he reached the place for paying custom dues, the collectors said, “Pay
us the custom”; and he replied, “I will pay your custom.” They said
to him, “Thou carriest clothes”; and he stated, “I will pay for clothes.”
Then they said to him, “Thou carriest gold”; and he answered, “I will
pay for gold.” On this they said to him, “Surely thou bearest the
finest silk”; and he replied, “I will pay custom for the finest silk.”
Then said they, “Truly it must be pearls that thou takest with thee”;
and he answered, “I will pay for pearls.” Seeing that they could name
nothing of value for which the patriarch was not willing to pay custom,
they said, “It cannot be but that thou open the box and let us see
what is within.” So the chest was opened, and the land was illumined
by the luster of Sarah’s beauty.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c017'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The love which the early Arabs bore to pearls is evidenced by the
references to them in the Koran, and especially the figurative description
given of Paradise. The stones are pearls and jacinths; the fruits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>of the trees are pearls and emeralds; and each person admitted to the
delights of the celestial kingdom is provided with a tent of pearls,
jacinths and emeralds; is crowned with pearls of incomparable luster,
and is attended by beautiful maidens resembling hidden pearls.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c017'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The estimation of pearls among the art-loving Greeks may be traced
to the time of Homer, who appears to have alluded to them under the
name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρίγληνα</span> (triple drops or beads) in his description of Juno; in
the Iliad, XIV, 183:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>In three bright drops,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her glittering gems suspended from her ears.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>and in the Odyssey, XVIII, 298:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>Earrings bright</div>
      <div class='line'>With triple drops that cast a trembling light.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Classical designs of Juno usually show the three pear-shaped pearls
pendent from her ears. The ancient Greeks probably obtained their
pearls from the East through the medium of Phenician traders, and
a survival of the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρίγληνα</span> seems to exist in the Welsh <i>glain</i>
(bead), the name having been carried to Britain by the same traders,
who exchanged textiles, glass beads, etc., for tin and salt.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Persian wars in the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, doubtless extended the
acquaintance which the Greeks had with pearls, as well as with other
oriental products, and increased their popularity. One of the earliest
of the Greek writers to mention pearls specifically appears to have
been Theophrastus (372–287 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), the disciple and successor of Aristotle,
who referred to them under the name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μαργαρίτης</span> (<i>margarites</i>),
probably derived from some oriental word like the Sanskrit <i>maracata</i>
or the Persian <i>mirwareed</i>. He stated that pearls were produced by
shell-fish resembling the <i>pinna</i>, only smaller, and were used in making
necklaces of great value. In Pliny’s “Historia naturalis,” that great
storehouse of classical learning, reference is made to many other
writers—mostly Greeks—who treated of gems; but virtually all of
these writings have disappeared, except fragments from Theophrastus,
Chares of Mytilene, and Isidorus of Charace.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>From Greece admiration for pearls quickly extended to Rome, where
they were known under the Greek word <i>margaritæ</i>. However, a more
common name for this gem in Rome was <i>unio</i>, which Pliny explained
by saying that each pearl was unique and unlike any other one. The
conclusion of the historian Ammianus Marcellinus (330–395 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>),
that it was because each one was found singly in a shell,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c017'><sup>[9]</sup></a> seems
scarcely correct. Claude de Saumaise, the French classical scholar,
thought that the common name for an onion was transferred to the
pearl, owing to its laminated construction.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c017'><sup>[10]</sup></a> According to Pliny, the
Romans used the word <i>unio</i> to distinguish a large perfect pearl from
the smaller and less attractive ones, which were called <i>margaritæ</i>.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c017'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>It was not until the Mithridatic Wars (88–63 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) and the conquests
by Pompey that pearls were very abundant and popular in
Rome, the great treasures of the East enriching the victorious army
and through it the aristocracy of the republic. In those greatest spectacular
functions the world has ever known—the triumphal processions
of the conquering Romans—pearls had a prominent part. Pliny
records that in great Pompey’s triumphal procession in 61 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> were
borne thirty-three crowns of pearls and numerous pearl ornaments,
including a portrait of the victor, and a shrine dedicated to the muses,
adorned with the same gems.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c017'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The luxuries of Mithridates, the treasures of Alexandria, the riches
of the Orient were poured into the lap of victory-fattened Rome. From
that time the pearl reigned supreme, not only in the enormous prices
given for single specimens, but also in the great abundance in possession
of the degenerate descendants of the victorious Romans. The interior
of the temple of Venus was decorated with pearls. The dress
of the wealthy was so pearl-bedecked that Pliny exclaimed in irony:
“It is not sufficient for them to wear pearls, but they must trample and
walk over them”;<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c017'><sup>[13]</sup></a> and the women wore pearls even in the still hours
of the night, so that in their sleep they might be conscious of possessing
the beautiful gems.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c017'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>It is related that the voluptuous Caligula (12–41 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>)—he who
raised his favorite horse Incitatus to the consulship—decorated that
horse with a pearl necklace, and that he himself wore slippers embroidered
with pearls; and the tyrannical Nero (37–68 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>), not content
with having his scepter and throne of pearls, provided the actors in his
theater with masks and scepters decorated with them. Thus wrote
the observant Philo, the envoy of the Jews to the Emperor Caligula:
“The couches upon which the Romans recline at their repasts shine
with gold and pearls; they are splendid with purple coverings interwoven
with pearls and gold.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet not all the men of Rome were enthusiastic over the beautiful
“gems of the sea, which resemble milk and snow,” as the poet Manlius
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>called them. Even then, as now, there were some faultfinders. The
immortal Cæsar interdicted their use by women beneath a certain
rank; Martial and Tibullus inveighed against them; the witty Horace
directed his stinging shafts of satire against the extravagance. Referring
to a woman named Gellia, Martial wrote: “By no gods or goddesses
does she swear, but by her pearls. These she embraces and
kisses. These she calls her brothers and sisters. She loves them more
dearly than her two sons. Should she by some chance lose them, the
miserable woman would not survive an hour.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c017'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Hear what stern old
Seneca had to say: “Pearls offer themselves to my view. Simply one
for each ear? No! The lobes of our ladies have attained a special
capacity for supporting a great number. Two pearls alongside of
each other, with a third suspended above, now form a single earring!
The crazy fools seem to think that their husbands are not sufficiently
tormented unless they wear the value of an inheritance in each ear!”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c017'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The prices reported for some choice ones at that time seem fabulous.
It is recorded by Suetonius, that the Roman general, Vitellius, paid the
expenses of a military campaign with the proceeds of one pearl from
his mother’s ears: “<i>Atque ex aure matris detractum unionem pigneraverit
ad itineris impensas</i>.” In his “<i>Historia naturalis</i>,” Pliny says
that in the first century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, they ranked first in value among all
precious things,<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c017'><sup>[17]</sup></a> and reports sixty million sestertii<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c017'><sup>[18]</sup></a> as the value of the
two famous pearls—“the singular and only jewels of the world and
even nature’s wonder”—which Cleopatra wore at the celebrated banquet
to Mark Antony. And Suetonius<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c017'><sup>[19]</sup></a> places at six million sestertii
the value of the one presented by Julius Cæsar as a tribute of love to
Servilia, the mother of Brutus, who thus wore</p>

<p class='c018'>Or, as St. Jerome expressed it in his “Vita Pauli Eremitæ”:</p>

<p class='c013'>We are told by Ælius Lampridius that an ambassador once brought
to Alexander Severus two remarkably large and heavy pearls for the
empress. The emperor offered them for sale, and as no purchaser was
found, he had them hung in the ears of the statue of Venus, saying:
“If the empress should have such pearls, she would give a bad example
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>to the other women, by wearing an ornament of so much value that no
one could pay for it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The word “margarita” was used symbolically to designate the most
cherished object; for instance, a favorite child. In an inscription
published by Fabretti, p. 44, No. 253, the word <i>margaritio</i> has the same
significance. (Sex. Bruttidio juveni margaritioni carissimo, vixit
annis II mensibus VII, diebus XVIII.)<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c017'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>While the ancient writers were familiar with the pearl itself, they
knew little of the fisheries, and related many curious stories which had
come to Athens and Rome. Pliny and Ælianus quoted from Megasthenes
that the pearl-oysters lived in communities like swarms of bees,
and were governed by one remarkable for its size and great age, and
which was wonderfully expert in keeping its subjects out of danger,
and that the fishermen endeavored first to catch this one, so that the
others might easily be secured. Procopius, one of the most entertaining
of the old Byzantine chroniclers, wrote of social relations between
the pearl-oysters and the sharks, and of methods of inducing the
growth of pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>The principal fisheries of antiquity were in the Persian Gulf, on the
coasts of Ceylon and India, and in the Red Sea. The pearls referred to
in ancient Chinese literature appear to have been taken from the rivers
and ponds of that country, while those in Cochin China and Japan
seem to have come from the adjoining seas. The pearls were distributed
among the nations in control of the fisheries, and from them,
other people received collections, either as presents, in conquest, or by
way of trade. History makes no mention of pearls having been obtained
elsewhere than in the Orient up to the time of Julius Cæsar,
when small quantities of inexpensive ones were collected in Britain
by the invading Romans. And in the first century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, Pliny states
that small reddish pearls were found about Italy and in the Bosphorus
Straits near Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c013'>A number of specimens of pearls of the artistic Greeks and of the
luxurious Romans are yet in existence, and some of these are in a
fairly good state of preservation. A notable and interesting example
is a superb Greek necklace of pearls and gold, referred to the third
century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York. Several earrings now in that museum, in the Hermitage at
St. Petersburg, the British Museum, the Louvre in Paris, and in the
Boston Museum of Fine Arts, are shown in this book. Some of these
may have decorated ears that listened to the comedies of Aristophanes,
the tragedies of Euripides, the philosophies of Plato, or the oratory
of Demosthenes. A number of classic statues have the ears pierced

<p class='c013'>The beautiful Tyszkiewicz bronze statuette of Aphrodite was
acquired in 1900 by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and has even
yet a pearl in a fairly good state of preservation suspended from each
ear by a spiral thread of gold which passes quite through the gem and
also through the lobe of the ear. This statuette has been described as
“the most beautiful bronze Venus known.”<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c017'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Professor Froehner considers
that it belongs nearer to the period of Phidias (<i>circa</i> 500–430
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) than to that of Praxiteles (<i>circa</i> 400–336 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>); but Dr. Edward
Robinson does not concur in this opinion, and refers it to the Hellenic
period (<i>circa</i> 330–146 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>).</p>

<p class='c013'>However, considering the very large accumulations, relatively few
pearls of antiquity now remain, and none of these is of great ornamental
value. Those in archæological collections and art museums are
more or less decayed through the ravages of time and accident to
which they have been subjected. While coins, gold jewelry, crystal
gems, etc., of ancient civilizations are relatively numerous, the less
durable pearls have not survived the many centuries of pillage, waste,
and burial in the earth.</p>

<p class='c013'>A well-known instance of this decay is found in the Stilicho pearls,
which owe their prominence to the incident of their long burial. The
daughters of this famous Roman general, who were successively betrothed
to the Emperor Honorius, died in 407 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, and were buried
with their pearls and ornaments. In 1526, or more than eleven centuries
afterward, in excavating for an extension of St. Peter’s, the
tomb was opened, and the ornaments were found in fair condition,
except the pearls, which were as lusterless and dead as a wreath of
last year’s flowers.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>The popularity of pearls in Rome has its counterpart in the
Empire of the East at Byzantium or Constantinople on its
development in wealth and luxury after becoming the capital
of that empire in 330 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> Owing to its control of the trade
between Asia and Europe, and the influence of oriental taste and
fashion, enormous collections were made; and for centuries after
Rome had been pillaged, this capital was the focus of all the arts, and
pearls were the favorite ornaments. The famous mosaic in the sanctuary
of San Vitale at Ravenna, shows Justinian (483–565) with his
head covered with a jeweled cap, and the Empress Theodora wearing a
tiara encircled by three rows of pearls, and strings of pearls depend
therefrom almost to the waist. In many instances the decorations of
the emperors excelled even those of the most profligate of Roman
rulers. An examination of the coins, from those of Arcadius in 395
to the last dribble of a long line of obscure rulers when the city was
captured and pillaged by Venetian and Latin adventurers in 1204,
shows in the form of diadems, collars, necklaces, etc., the great quantity
of pearls worn by them. The oldest existing crown in use at the
present time, the Hungarian crown of St. Stephen, which is radiant
with pearls, is of Byzantine workmanship.</p>

<p class='c013'>Outside of Constantinople, the demand and fashion for pearls did
not cease with the downfall of the Roman Empire and the spoliation of
Rome in the fifth century. The treasures accumulated there, and the
gems and jewels, were carried away by the conquering Goths and
scattered among the great territorial lords of western and northern
Europe.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the ancient cities of Gaul, in Toulouse and Narbonne, the Ostrogoth
and the Visigoth kings collected enormous treasures. The citadel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of Carcassonne held magnificent spoils brought from the sacking of
Rome in 410 by Alaric, king of the Ostrogoths, consisting in part of jewels
from the Temple, these having been carried to Rome after the spoliation
of Jerusalem in 70 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> Several beautiful objects of this and somewhat
later periods are yet in existence, notably the Visigothic crowns
and crosses, in the Musée de l’Hôtel de Cluny, Paris, the most beautiful
of which are probably the crown and the cross of Reccesvinthus.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c017'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Even as the treasures of Rome were despoiled by the Ostrogoths
and the Visigoths, so, later, their collections were depleted by the military
operations of the Franks, when Narbonne was pillaged; when
Toulouse was sacked by Clovis, or Chlodowig, in 507; when the
churches of Barcelona and Toledo were despoiled by Childebert in 531
and 542; and by various expeditions in succeeding years.</p>

<p class='c013'>The military triumphs of the Franks placed them in the highest
rank among the peoples of Europe, in the sixth and seventh centuries,
in the possession of treasures of jewels which enriched their palaces
and great churches. And the taste which the triumphs of war had
developed was maintained by the trade carried on by the Jewish and
Syrian merchants. The inhabitants of Gaul were extremely fond of
objects of art, of rich costumes, and of personal decorations; and the
courts of some of the early kings rivaled in magnificence those of
oriental monarchs. Especially was this true during the reign of King
Dagobert (628–638), who competed in splendor with the rulers of
Persia and India. His skilful jeweler, Eligius (588–659), was raised
to the bishopric of Noyon, and eventually—under the name of St. Eloi—became
one of the most popular saints in Gaul. Under direction of
this artistic bishop, the ancient churches received shrines, vestments,
and reliquaries superbly decorated with pearls and other gems. Indeed,
for several centuries following the time of Eligius, the greatest
treasures of jewels seem to have been collected in the churches.</p>

<p class='c013'>The use of gems in enriching regalia, vestments, and reliquaries in
Europe, advanced greatly during the reign of Charlemagne (768–814);
and princes and bishops competed with each other in the magnificence
of their gifts to the churches, sacrificing their laical jewels
for the sacred treasures. Few of the great ornaments of Charlemagne’s
time are now in existence in the original form. Doubtless the
most remarkable pieces are the sacred regalia of the great emperor,
preserved among the imperial treasures in Vienna.</p>

<p>FRONT COVER OF ASHBURNHAM MANUSCRIPT OF THE FOUR GOSPELS<br /><br />From the ninth century. One quarter of the actual dimensions.<br /><br />Owned by J. Pierpont Morgan, Esq.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>An artistic use for pearls at that time was in the rich and elegant
bindings of the splendidly written missals and chronicles, finished in
the highest degree of excellence and at vast expense. An artist might
devote his whole life to completing a single manuscript, so great was
the detail and so exquisite the finish. Vasari states that Julio Clovio
devoted nine years to painting twenty-six miniatures in the Breviary
of the Virgin now in the royal library at Naples. The library at
Rouen has a large missal on which a monk of St. Andoen is said to
have labored for thirty years. These books were among the most
valued possessions of the churches, and their bindings were enriched
with gold and pearls and colored stones. The wealthy churches had
many such volumes; Gregory of Tours states that from Barcelona in
531 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> Childebert brought twenty “<i>evangeliorum capsas</i>” of pure
gold set with gems. Several of these superbly bound volumes are yet
in existence, in the Basilica of St. Mark in Venice; in the treasury of
the cathedral at Milan; among the imperial Russian collections in the
Ourejenaya Palata at Moscow, etc.; and they furnish probably the
most reliable examples of artistic jewel work of the Dark Ages.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most remarkable specimen of these books in America is doubtless
the Ashburnham manuscript of the Four Gospels, now owned by
J. Pierpont Morgan, Esq., which affords an interesting example of the
jeweler’s art. For many centuries it belonged to the Abbey of the
Noble Canonesses, founded, in 834, at Lindau, on Lake Constance.
After an extended examination, Mr. Alexander Nesbit concluded
that the rich cover of the manuscript was probably made between
896 and 899 by order of Emperor Arnulf of the Carolingian dynasty.
Most of the ninety-eight pearls appear to be from fresh water, and
probably all of them were obtained from the rivers of Europe. This
is one of the few remaining pieces of the magnificent ecclesiastical
jeweling of that period.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the death of Charlemagne, internal dissensions, separations
and the division of the Empire into the nations of Europe, annihilated
commerce, oppressed the people, and impoverished the arts. In the
ninth century, the Normans pillaged many of the palaces and churches
in Angoulême, Tours, Orléans, Rouen, and Paris, and destroyed or
carried away large treasures. The tenth and the eleventh centuries
were indeed the Dark Ages in respect to the cultivation of the arts; yet
even during that period the churches of western Europe received many
gems from penitent and fear-stricken subjects. The heart of man,
filled with the love of God, laid its earthly treasure upon the altar in
exchange for heavenly consolation. Pious faith dedicated pearls to the
glorification of the ritual; altars, statues, and images of the saints,
priestly vestments, and sacred vessels, were surcharged with them.
The great museums and the imperial collections contain some beautiful
and highly venerated objects of this nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the meantime pearls of small size and of fair luster had been
collected in the rivers of Scotland, Ireland, and France, the headwaters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>of the Danube, and in the countries north thereof. In England, as
noted in the preceding chapter, they were obtained by Cæsar’s invading
legions, who carried many to Rome. Ancient coins indicate that pearls
formed the principal ornament of the simple crowns worn by the early
kings of Britain previous to Alfred the Great.</p>

<p class='c013'>The river pearls were not so beautiful as oriental ones; but, owing
to the ease with which they were obtained, they were employed more
extensively and especially in ecclesiastical decorations, the principal
use for pearls from the eighth to the eleventh century. Apparently
authentic specimens of fresh-water pearls of an early period are the
four now in the coronation spoon of the English regalia, which is attributed
to the twelfth century.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the most ancient times until the overthrow of the Roman
Empire, practically the only use for pearls was ornamental; but after
the eighth century there developed a new employment for these as well
as for other gems. Natural history was little studied in Europe from
the ninth to the fourteenth century, except for the effect which its subjects
had in medicine and magic, which were closely allied. Largely
through Arabic influence, the practice of medicine had developed into
administering most whimsical remedies, among which gems, and especially
pearls, played a prominent part, and belief in the influence of
these was as strong as in that of the heavenly bodies. For this application,
large demands had arisen for pearls, which seem to have been
prescribed for nearly every ill to which the flesh was heir. On account
of their cheapness, the small ones—seed-pearls—were used principally;
though larger ones were preferred by persons who could afford them.
While many of these so-called medicinal pearls were obtained from the
Orient, most of them were secured from the home streams in the north
of Europe and in the British Isles.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the decadence of Roman power in the East, the rulers of
India and Persia, through their control of the fisheries, again accumulated
enormous quantities of pearls. All of the early travelers to those
countries were astonished at the lavish display of these gems in decorative
costume.</p>

<p class='c013'>The manuscript of Renaudot’s two Mohammedans, who visited India
and China in the ninth century, notes that the kings of the Indies
were rich in ornaments, “yet pearls are what they most esteem, and
their value surpasses that of all other jewels; they hoard them up in
their treasures with their most precious things. The grandees of the
court, the great officers and captains, wear the like jewels in their
collars.”<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c017'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Inventories of some of the oriental collections of later times seem to
be extravagant fiction rather than veritable history. In that interesting
book dictated in a Genoese prison to Rusticiano da Pisa, accounts
are given by Marco Polo of great treasures seen by the first Europeans
to penetrate into China. He describes the king of Malabar as wearing
suspended about his neck a string of 104 large pearls and rubies of
great value, which he used as a rosary. Likewise on his legs were
anklets and on his toes were rings, all thickly set with costly pearls, the
whole “worth more than a city’s ransom. And ’tis no wonder he hath
great store of such gear; for they are found in his kingdom. No one
is permitted to remove therefrom a pearl weighing more than half a
<i>saggio</i>. The king desires to reserve all such to himself, and so the
quantity he has is almost incredible.”<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c017'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Later travelers give wonderful descriptions of this excessive passion
for pearls. Literature is full of this appreciation, and of the part
which these gems played in the affairs of the Orientals. Who has not
dwelt with delight upon those imperishable legends such as are embodied
in the Arabian Nights, of the pearl voyages by Sindbad the
Sailor, of the wonderful treasure chests, and of the superb necklaces
adorning the beautiful black-eyed women!</p>

<p class='c013'>The returning Crusaders in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and
the development of the knightly orders, had much to do with spreading
through Europe a fondness for pearls in personal decoration. Those
who, like Chaucer’s knight, had been with Peter, King of Cyprus, at
the capture and plunder when “Alexandria was won,” returned to their
homes with riches of pearls and gold and precious stones. And learning
much relative to decorative art from Moorish craftsmen, the jewelers
of western Europe set these in designs not always crude and ineffective.</p>

<p class='c013'>Although they were well known and valued, pearls do not seem to
have been much used in England before the twelfth century, as the
Anglo-Saxons were not an especially art-loving people. The word itself
is of foreign derivation and occurs in a similar form in all modern
languages, both Romance and Teutonic; <i>perle</i>, French and German;
<i>perla</i>, Italian, Portuguese, Provençal, Spanish, and Swedish; <i>paarl</i>,
Danish and Dutch. Its origin is doubtful. Some philologists consider
it Teutonic and the diminutive of <i>beere</i>, a berry; Claude de Saumaise
derives it from <i>pirula</i>, the diminutive of <i>pirum</i>, a sphere; while Diez
and many others refer it to <i>pira</i> or to the medieval Latin <i>pirula</i>, in
allusion to the pear shape frequently assumed by the pearl.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c017'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>The word pearl seems to have come into general use in the English
language about the fourteenth century. In Wyclif’s translation of the
Scriptures (about 1360), he commonly used the word <i>margarite</i> or
<i>margaritis</i>, whereas Tyndale’s translation (1526) in similar places
used the word <i>perle</i>. Tyndale translated Matt. xiii. 46: “When he
had founde one precious pearle”; Wyclif used “oo preciouse margarite.”
Also in Matt. vii. 6, Tyndale wrote, “Nether caste ye youre
pearles before swyne”; yet Wyclif used “margaritis,” although twenty
years later he expressed it “putten precious perlis to hoggis.” Langland’s
Piers Plowman (1362), XI, 9, wrote this: “<i>Noli mittere</i> Margeri
perles Among hogges.” The oldest English version of Mandeville’s
Travels, written about 1400, contained the expression: “The fyn
Perl congeles and wexes gret of the dew of hevene”; but in 1447,
Bokenham’s “Seyntys” stated: “A margerye perle aftyr the phylosophyr
Growyth on a shelle of lytyl pryhs”; and Knight de la Tour
(about 1450) stated: “The sowle is the precious marguarite unto
God.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The word is given “perle” in the earliest manuscripts of those old
epic poems of the fourteenth century, “Pearl” and “Cleanness,” which
have caused so much learned theological discussion and which testify
to the great love and esteem in which the gem was held. The first
stanza of “Pearl” we quote from Gollancz’s rendition:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Pearl! fair enow for princes’ pleasance,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>so deftly set in gold so pure,—</div>
      <div class='line'>from orient lands I durst avouch,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>ne’er saw I a gem its peer,—</div>
      <div class='line'>so round, so comely-shaped withal,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>so small, with sides so smooth,—</div>
      <div class='line'>where’er I judged of radiant gems,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I placed my pearl supreme.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c017'><sup>[27]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The fourteenth-century manuscript in the British Museum gives
this as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Perle plesaunte to prynces paye,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>And from a modern rendering of “Cleanness” we quote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The pearl is praised wherever gems are seen,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>though it be not the dearest by way of merchandise.</div>
      <div class='line'>Why is the pearl so prized, save for its purity,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>that wins praise for it above all white stones?</div>
      <div class='line'>It shineth so bright; it is so round of shape;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>without fault or stain; if it be truly a pearl.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries throughout Europe pearls
were very fashionable as personal ornaments, and were worn in enormous
quantities; the dresses of men as well as of women were decorated
and embroidered with them, and they were noted in nearly every
account of a festive occasion, whether it were a marriage, a brilliant
tourney, the consecration of a bishop, or the celebration of a victory in
battle.</p>

<p class='c013'>The faceting of crystal gems was not known at that time, and those
dependent on artifice for their beauty were not much sought after. Although
the diamond had been known from the eighth century, it was
not generally treasured as an ornament, and not until long after the
invention of cutting in regular facets—about 1450—did it attain its
great popularity.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Dark Ages, it was customary for princes and great nobles to
carry their valuables about with them even on the battle-fields; first, in
order to have them always in possession, and second, on account of
the mysterious power they attributed to precious stones. Since jewels
constituted a large portion of their portable wealth, nobles and knights
went into battle superbly arrayed. In this manner the treasures were
easily lost and destroyed; consequently, relatively few of the personal
ornaments of that period are preserved to the present time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the greatest lovers of pearls in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries were the members of the ducal house of Burgundy, and
especially Philip the Bold (1342–1404), Philip the Good (1396–1467),
and Charles the Bold (1433–77), and some of the gems which they
owned are even now treasured in Austria, Spain, and Italy. When
Duke Charles the Bold, in the year 1473, attended the Diet of Treves,
accompanied by his five thousand splendidly equipped horsemen, he
was attired in cloth of gold garnished with pearls, which were valued
at 200,000 golden florins.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c017'><sup>[28]</sup></a> We are told that “almost a sea of pearls”
was on view at the marriage of George the Rich with Hedwig, the
daughter of Casimir III of Poland, at Landshut, in 1475. Among
the many ornaments was a pearl chaplet valued at 50,000 florins which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Duke George wore on his hat, and also a clasp worth 6000 florins.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c017'><sup>[29]</sup></a>
Members of the related houses of Anjou and Valois also held great
collections. Nor in this account should we omit some of the English
sovereigns, including especially Richard II (1366–1400), one of the
greatest dandies of his day.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the fifteenth century, enormous quantities of pearls were
worn by persons of rank and fashion. A remarkable 1483 portrait of
Margaret, wife of James III of Scotland, which is now preserved at
Hampton Court, shows her wearing such wonderful pearl ornaments
that she might well be called Margaret from her decorations. As this
queen was praised for her beauty, we fear the artist has scarcely done
justice to her appearance; or possibly since that period tastes have
changed as to what on a throne passes for beauty. Her head-dress is
undoubtedly the most remarkable pearl decoration which we have seen
of that century.</p>

<p class='c013'>The uxorious and sumptuous Henry VIII of England (1491–1547)
spent much of the great wealth accumulated by his penurious father,
Henry VII, in enriching the appearance of his semi-barbaric court.
In this reign, the spoliation of the Catholic cathedrals and churches
contributed many pearls to the royal treasury; and onward from that
time, they were prominently displayed among the ornaments of the
women of rank in England. Most of the portraits of Henry’s wives
show great quantities of these gems; many of them with settings
doubtless designed by artistic Hans Holbein the Younger (1497–1543);
and during the succeeding reigns the women near the throne
were commonly depicted with elaborate pearl decorations.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cold, unflattering portraits by Holbein of the court celebrities
of that period, not only of the gracious women and of the dandified
men, but of the clergy as well, show the prominence of pearls. Note
his portrait of Jane Seymour, of Anne of Cleves, of Christina of Denmark,
and the pearl-incrusted miter of Archbishop Warham of
Canterbury.</p>

<p class='c013'>An interesting story is told of Sir Thomas More, the learned chancellor
of Henry VIII, showing his view of the great display of jewels
which distinguished the period in which he lived:</p>

<p class='c020'>His sonne John’s wife often had requested her father-in-law, Sir Thomas,
to buy her a billiment sett with pearles. He had often put her off with many
pretty slights; but at last, for her importunity, he provided her one. Instead
of pearles, he caused white peaze to be sett, so that at his next coming home,
his daughter-in-law demanded her jewel. “Ay, marry, daughter, I have not
forgotten thee!” So out of his studie he sent for a box, and solemnlie delivered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>it to her. When she, with great joy, lookt for her billiment, she found,
far from her expectation, a billiment of peaze; and so she almost wept for
verie griefe.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c017'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile, in the yet unknown America, pearls were highly prized,
and their magic charm had taken an irresistible hold on aborigines and
on the more highly civilized inhabitants of Mexico and Peru. In
Mexico the palaces of Montezuma were studded with pearls and emeralds,
and the Aztec kings possessed pearls of inestimable value. That
they had been collected elsewhere for a long time is evidenced by the
large quantities in the recently opened mounds of the Ohio Valley,
which rank among the ancient works of man in America. As in the
Old World, so in the New, they had been used as decoration for the
gods and for the temples, as well as for men and women.</p>

<p class='c013'>The principal immediate effect of Columbus’s discovery and of the
commercial intercourse with the New World, was the great wealth of
pearls which enriched the Spanish traders. The natives were found
in possession of rich fisheries on the coast of Venezuela, and somewhat
later on the Pacific coast of Panama and Mexico, whence Eldorado
adventurers returned to Spain with such large collections that—using
an old chronicler’s expression—“they were to every man like chaff.”
For many years America was best known in Seville, Cadiz, and some
other ports of Europe, as the land whence the pearls came. Until the
development of the mines in Mexico and Peru, the value of the pearls
exceeded that of all other exports combined. Humboldt states that till
1530 these averaged in value more than 800,000 piastres yearly.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c017'><sup>[31]</sup></a> And
throughout the sixteenth century the American fisheries—prosecuted
by the Spaniards with the help of native labor—furnished Europe with
large quantities, the records for one year showing imports of “697
pounds’ weight” into Seville alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>For two centuries following the discovery of America, extravagance
in personal decoration was almost unlimited at the European courts,
and the pearls exceeded in quantity that of all other gems. Enormous
numbers were worn by persons of rank and fortune. This is apparent,
not only from the antiquarian records and the historical accounts, but
also in the paintings and engravings of that time; portraits of the
Hapsburgs, the Valois, the Medicis, the Borgias, the Tudors, and
the Stuarts show great quantities of pearls, and relatively few other
gems.</p>

<p class='c013'>Probably the largest treasures were in possession of the Hapsburg
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>family, which furnished so many sovereigns to the Holy Roman Empire,
to Austria, and to Spain, and which, by descent through Maria
Theresa, continued to rule the Holy Roman Empire until its abolition
in 1806, and has since ruled Austria and Hungary.</p>

<p class='c013'>A number of superb pieces of jewelry owned centuries ago by members
of this illustrious family are yet in existence; notably the buckle
of Charles V, and especially the imperial crown of Austria, made in
1602 by order of Rudolph II.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c017'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Two great women of that period are noted for their passion for
pearls, Catharine de’ Medici (1519–89), and Elizabeth of England
(1533–1603). It requires but a glance at almost any of their portraits,
wherein they are represented wearing elaborate pearl ornaments,
to see to what an extent they carried this fondness. And many
other women were not far behind them, among whom were Mary
Stuart, Marie de’ Medici, and Henrietta Maria. And not only by the
women, but by the men also, pearls were worn to what now seems an
extravagant extent. Nearly all the portraits of Francis I (1494–1547),
Henry II (1519–59), Charles IX (1550–74), and Henry III
(1551–89) of France; of James I (1566–1625), and of Charles I
(1600–49) of England, and likewise of other celebrities, show a great
pear-shaped pearl in one ear. Many portraits also show pearls on the
hats, cloaks, gloves, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Duke of Buckingham went to Paris in 1625, to bring over
Henrietta Maria to be queen to Charles I, he had, according to an account
in the “Antiquarian Repertory,” in addition to twenty-six other
suits, “a rich suit of purple satin, embroidered all over with rich orient
pearls, the cloak made after the Spanish mode, with all things suitable,
the value whereof will be twenty thousand pounds, and this, it is
thought, shall be for the wedding day at Paris.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In the rich and prosperous cities of southern Europe, pearls were no
less popular. From its share of the spoils of the Byzantine Empire,
after its partition in 1204, pearls and other riches were plentiful in
Venice, and they were increased by the rapidly developing trade with
the Orient. In the rival maritime cities, Genoa and Pisa, the gem was
equally popular; and likewise in Florence “the Beautiful.” When
Hercule d’Este sought Lucrezia Borgia (1480–1519) in marriage for
his son, her father, Pope Alexander VI, plunging both hands in a box
filled with pearls, said: “All these are for her! I desire that in all Italy
she shall be the princess with the most beautiful pearls and with the
greatest number.”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c017'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Separated by three centuries of time and by the intervening simplicities
of puritanism and democracy, it is difficult for us to appreciate
the passion for pearls in Europe at that period, which may well be
called the Pearl Age.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>The sumptuary laws which prevailed at different times in France,
England, Germany, and other countries, did not overlook this extravagance;
and an entire volume might be devoted to the efforts to curb
the excessive use. In France they were probably most stringent during
the reign of Philip IV (1285–1314), of Louis XI (1461–83), of
Charles IX (1560–74), of Henry III (1574–89), and of Louis XIII
(1610–43). In Germany almost every city had its special restrictions.
A sumptuary law of Ulm, in 1345, provided that no married woman or
maiden, either among the patricians or the artisans, should wear pearls
on her dresses; and another, in 1411, restricted them to “one pearl
chaplet,” and this should not exceed twelve <i>loth</i> (half ounce) in
weight. A Frankish sumptuary law of 1479 provided that ordinary
nobles serving a knight at a tourney should not wear any pearl ornaments,
embroidered or otherwise, excepting one string around the cap
or hat. The regulations decreed by the Diet of Worms, in 1495, set
forth that the citizens who were not of noble birth, and nobles who
were not knights, must withhold from the use of gold and pearls. A
similar provision was enacted by the Diet of Freiburg in 1498, and
likewise by the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, which permitted the wives
of nobles four silk dresses, but without pearls. In the sumptuary law
of Duke John George of Saxony, April 23, 1612, we read: “the nobility
are not allowed to wear any dresses of gold or silver, or garnished with
pearls; neither shall the professors and doctors of the universities, nor
their wives, wear any gold, silver or pearls for fringes, or any chains
of pearls, or caps, neck ornaments, shoes, slippers, shawls, pins, etc.,
with gold or silver or with pearls.” Beadles, burgomasters, and those
connected with the law-courts were forbidden to wear chains of pearls
and ornaments of precious stones on their dresses, caps, etc., or slippers
or chaplets with pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Probably in no place were these laws more stringent than in the art-loving
republic of Venice from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century.
This seems remarkable in view of the fact that this city was largely
dependent for its wealth and prominence on commerce with the East,
of which pearls constituted a prominent item.</p>

<p class='c013'>The earliest Venetian restriction that we have found regarding
pearls was made in 1299; when, in a decree determining the maximum
number of guests at a marriage ceremony and the extent of the bridal
trousseau, the grand council of the republic provided that no one but
the bride should wear pearl decorations, and she should be permitted
only one girdle of them on her wedding dress. This enactment was
modified in 1306, but numerous other restrictions were substituted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>notably in 1334, 1340, 1360, 1497, and 1562. These differed in many
particulars: some forbade ornaments or trimmings of pearls, gold, or
silver on the dresses of any women except a member of the Doge’s
family; and other enactments required that, after a definite period of
married life, no woman should be permitted to wear pearls of any kind.
But an examination of the documents and of the paintings of that
period shows that these decrees had little effect, and the luxury of the
“Queen of the Adriatic” in the use of pearls at the most brilliant epoch
in her history is aptly reproduced in the portraits by Giovanni Bellini,
Lorenzo Lotto, the great Titian, Tintoretto, Paul Veronese, and other
artists of the highest rank. In the engraving by Hendrik Goltzius of
a marriage at Venice in 1584, not one of the many women present
seems to be without her necklace and earrings of pearls, and some of
them have several necklaces.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c017'><sup>[34]</sup></a> And the same appears true of the principal
female figures in Jost Amman’s noted engraving, “The Espousal
of the Sea,” executed in 1565.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c017'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>As preservation of the republic became more difficult with declining
resources and with the continued growth of dazzling splendor, a resolution
in the Senate, dated July 8, 1599, set forth that “the use
and price of pearls has become so excessive and increases to such an
extent from day to day, that if some remedy is not provided, it will
cause injury, disorders, and notable inconvenience to public and private
well-being, as each one of this council in his wisdom can very easily
appreciate.” And then it was enacted: “That, without repealing the
other regulations which absolutely prohibit the wearing of pearls, it
shall be expressly enjoined that any woman, whether of noble birth or
a simple citizen, or of any other condition, who shall reside in this our
city for one year (except her Serenity the Dogaressa and her daughters
and her daughters-in-law who live in the palace), after the expiration
of fifteen years from the day of her first marriage, shall lay aside
the string of pearls around her neck and shall not wear or use, either
upon her neck or upon any other part of her person, this string or any
other kind of pearls or anything which imitates pearls, neither in this
city nor in any other city or place within our dominion, under the irremissible
penalty of two hundred ducats.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And yet ten years later, on May 5, 1609, another law enacted in the
Senate stated:</p>

<p class='c020'>Although in the year 1599 this council decided with great wisdom that
married women should be permitted to wear pearls for only fifteen years after
their first marriage, nevertheless it is very evident that the desired end has
not been attained, and the extravagance has continued up to the present time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>and still continues with the gravest injury to private persons. Therefore,
as it is necessary to remedy, by a new provision, not only this considerable
incommodity, but also to prevent in the future the introduction into the city
of a greater quantity of pearls than are found here at present, it is enacted,
that married women as well as those who shall marry in the future (except
the Serene Dogaressa and her daughters and her daughters-in-law living in
the palace) of whatever grade and condition they may be, who have resided
in this city for one year, cannot wear pearls of any kind except for ten years
immediately following the day of their
first marriage; and after that period
they must lay aside these pearls which
they are forbidden to wear on any part
of their persons, at home or abroad,
and as well in this as in the other cities,
lands, and other places of our dominion,
under the penalty of two hundred
ducats. And if the husband of the offending
wife is a noble, he shall be
proclaimed in the greater council and
declared a debtor to the office of the
governors of the revenue in the sum of
twenty-five ducats for each fine; and if
he is a citizen or of any other condition,
besides the penalty of two hundred
ducats and the fine of twenty-five
ducats above mentioned, he shall be
banished for three years from Venice
and the Duchy, and the same for each
offence. And pearls or anything which
imitates pearls, shall be forbidden to
all other women, men and boys or girls
of every age and condition at all times
and in all places, under the same penalty
of two hundred ducats. In the future no one shall in any manner bring
pearls to this city as merchandise, under the penalty of their seizure and forfeiture.
And the merchant shall be imprisoned for five consecutive years; and
if he flees, he shall be banished from the city and district of Venice and from
all other cities, lands, and places of our dominion for eight consecutive years....
And all who at present have pearls to sell are required to deposit a list of
them with the sumptuary office, so as to avoid all fraud which could be practiced
in this matter.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>A copy of the title-page of this enactment is presented above.</p>

<p class='c013'>The decrees and edicts were not confined to Venice, or to Italy,
France, or Germany; they made their appearance quite generally
throughout western and northern Europe and the interdictions of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>civil authorities were strengthened by the voice of the bishops and
other clergy, especially in the imperial cities of southern Germany. Yet
the united authority of church and state was ineffectual in stemming
the tide of fashion and personal fancy, and whether or not pearls
should be worn became one of the much discussed questions of that
period.</p>

<p class='c013'>To the question, “Whether the statute and regulation of Bishop Tudertinus,
who had excommunicated all women who wore pearls, was
binding,” Joannes Guidius replied that many denied that this was so,
and made the subtle defense that “the women had not accepted it and
all had worn pearls, and it was considered that such a law was binding
only when it was accepted by those for whom it was intended.”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c017'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>And as to the validity of the statutes requiring that women should
not wear more than a definite number of pearls, he decided that “such
a statute is valid and in itself good. And if the question is put whether
every woman who infringes incurs the penalty, an answer may be gathered
from the sayings of the doctors, who distinguish between married
and unmarried women. They consider that an unmarried woman is
obliged to obey the statute and regulation or to incur the penalty. But
as to a married woman, if her husband approves, she should obey the
statute; if, however, the husband objects, then the wife ought to wish
to obey the statute, but in effect she should rather obey her husband,
for she is most immediately and strongly bound to do this.”<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c017'><sup>[37]</sup></a> Aided
by such ingenious opinions as these, the women continued to follow
their own inclinations notwithstanding the opposition of church and
state.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other fine distinctions were drawn by the lawyers of that day regarding
ownership of gems under certain conditions. For instance, it
was decided that pearls given by a father to his unmarried daughter
remained her property after marriage because “they are given for a
reason, namely to induce a marriage”; yet “pearls handed to a wife by
her husband are not considered as her property, but must be given to
his heirs, since it is supposed that they were given only for her adornment.
The same holds good as respects pearls handed to a daughter-in-law
by her father-in-law.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c017'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>However, the greed of fashion, which law-makers and bishops could
not arrest, was gradually satiated; and, influenced probably by the
horrors of the Thirty Years’ War, more simple taste prevailed in the
latter part of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the meantime, improvements in cutting and polishing had greatly
increased the beauty and popularity of diamonds and other crystal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>gems, and this adversely affected the demand for pearls. Furthermore,
cleverly fashioned imitations manufactured at a low cost also
served to decrease the relative rank and fashion of the sea-born gems.
In the eighteenth century, pearls were relatively scarce; the resources
of the American seas were largely exhausted, likewise the Ceylon and
Red Sea fisheries were not to be depended on, and practically the entire
supply came from the Persian Gulf, with a few from European rivers
and the waters of China. As a result, although they continued to be
prized by connoisseurs, pearls were not so extensively sought after by
the rank and file of jewel purchasers.</p>

<p class='c013'>It should be noted, however, that from the most ancient times, the
princes of India and of Persia have had their pick and choice of the
output from Ceylon and the Persian Gulf; and the largest single collections
of the Western world have never equaled the possessions of
some of those rulers. Some Indian princes have loaded themselves
with thousands of pearls, and individual ornaments have been valued
not only by oriental, but by European experts, at several millions of
dollars.</p>

<p class='c013'>The great diamond resources of Brazil were discovered in 1727,
and after a few years these came on the market at the rate of 140,000
carats annually. At that time ladies of rank did not esteem diamonds
so highly as pearls. This distinction was accentuated by Lord Hervey
in his account of the coronation, in 1727, of George II and his consort
Caroline, who wore not only the great pearl necklace inherited from
Queen Anne, but “had on her head and shoulders all the pearls she
could borrow of the ladies of quality at one end of the town, and on
her petticoat all the diamonds she could hire of the Jews and jewelers
at the other; so that the appearance and the truth of her finery was a
mixture of magnificence and meanness not unlike the <i>éclat</i> of royalty
in many other particulars, when it comes to be nicely considered and
its source traced to what money hires or flattery lends.”<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c017'><sup>[39]</sup></a> In a portrait
of Charlotte (1744–1818), wife of George III, the pearls and
diamonds appear equally popular.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the entry of the British into possession of Ceylon in 1796, the
fisheries of that country were resumed with great success after thirty
years of idleness, resulting in very large outputs for several seasons.
But owing to exhaustion of the areas, they were soon reduced, and the
yield became small and uncertain.</p>

<p class='c013'>About 1845, pearls came on the market from the Tuamotu Archipelago
and other South Sea islands, and the industry was revived on
the Mexican coast. The pearls from these localities are noted for
their range of coloration, and particularly for the very dark shades,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>black or greenish black being especially prominent. But the fashion,
and thus, necessarily, the demand, had always been for white and yellow
pearls; consequently, these black ones were of little value in the
markets until about ten years later, when they became fashionable in
Europe largely through their popularity with Empress Eugénie of
France, then at the height of her power. To this queen, pearls owe
much of their high rank in fashion in the nineteenth century; and on
her head they were royal gems royally worn, as appears from Winterhalter’s
portrait of her, showing her magnificent necklace.</p>

<p class='c013'>The discovery of the resources on the Australian coast about 1865,
and the development of the fishery there for mother-of-pearl, resulted
in many large white pearls coming from that coast. The search was
confined to the relatively shoal waters, until the introduction of diving-suits
about 1880. The use of these facilitated a considerable extension
of the fisheries not only on the Australian coast, but also in Mexico,
the Malay Archipelago, several of the South Sea islands, and some
minor localities.</p>

<p class='c013'>In America, few jewels were worn previous to the Civil War, owing
to the absence of great wealth and to the simplicity of taste in personal
decorations. The rapid increase in wealth and luxury, on the
termination of that war, resulted in a great demand for gems, and the
most brilliant and showy ones were selected, especially diamonds. This
demand was the more readily supplied by the discovery of the South
African mines, with their great yield from 1870 to the present time.
So popular did that gem become that many a young man invested his
first earnings in a “brilliant,” and an enormous diamond in the shirt-front
became the caricatured emblem of a prosperous hotel clerk.</p>

<p class='c013'>But in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, in Europe, as well
as in America and elsewhere where gems are worn, luxury found in
pearls a refinement, associated with richness and beauty, exceeding
that of diamonds and other crystal gems, and in the last few years they
have taken the highest rank among jewels. This change in fashion
and the increase in wealth among the people developed vastly greater
demands and consequently very much higher prices. These have resulted
in greatly extending the field of search, and during the last two
or three decades many new territories have been brought into production.</p>

<p class='c013'>By far the most important of these new regions is the Mississippi
Valley in America, the pearl resources of which were made known
about a score of years ago. As the exploitation developed, the gems
from these streams added very largely to the supply, especially of
the baroque or irregular pearls, which have increased greatly in
fashion in the last ten years.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Notwithstanding the popular idea that pearls are scarce owing to
depletion of the fisheries, they are doubtless produced in greater
quantities at present than ever before in the history of the world.
True, they were more plentiful in Rome after the Persian conquest,
and in Spain immediately following the exploitation of tropical America;
but it is highly probable that in no equal period have the entire
fisheries of the world yielded greater quantities than in the five years
from 1903 to 1907 inclusive. Certain individual fisheries are now less
productive than at the height of their prosperity; those in the Red Sea
do not compare favorably with their condition in ancient times, the
European resources are nearly exhausted, the supplies from the
Venezuelan coast do not equal those obtained early in the sixteenth
century, the yield from Mexico is not so extensive as twenty-five years
ago, and the same is true of some other regions. On the other hand,
the great fisheries of Persia and Ceylon are yet very prosperous, the
Ceylon fishery of 1905 surpassing all records, and the number of minor
pearling regions has largely increased.</p>

<p class='c013'>The present value of pearls—which has advanced enormously since
1893—is due to the extended markets and the increased wealth and
fashion in Western countries, rather than to diminished fisheries. The
oriental demand still consumes the bulk of the Persian and Indian
output, and the vast increase in wealth among the middle classes in
America, Europe, and elsewhere, has increased the demand tenfold
over that of a century ago. While women no longer appear ornamented
from head to foot as in the sixteenth century, pearls are in the
highest fashion, and the woman of rank and wealth usually prizes first
among her jewels her necklace of pearls.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>The origin of pearls has been a fruitful subject of speculation
and discussion among naturalists of all ages, and has provoked
many curious explanations. Most of the early views—universally
accepted during those centuries when tradition
had more influence than observation and experiment—have no standing
among naturalists at the present time. And although much information
has been gained as to the conditions accompanying their
growth, and many theories are entertained, each with some basis in
observed fact, science does not yet speak with conclusive and unquestioned
authority as to the precise manner of their origin and development.</p>

<p class='c013'>Owing to the chaste and subdued beauty of pearls, it is not strange
that poets of many countries have founded their origin in tears—tears
of angels, of water-nymphs, of the lovely and devoted. Sir Walter
Scott in “The Bridal of Triermain” refers to—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In luster they so closely resemble the limpid, sparkling dewdrop as
it first receives the sun’s rays, that the ancients very naturally conceived
that pearls are formed from drops of dew or rain. The usual
legend is, that at certain seasons of the year, the pearl-oysters rise to
the surface of the water in the morning, and there open their shells
and imbibe the dewdrops; these, aided by the breath of the air and the
warmth of the sunlight, are, in the course of time, transformed into
lustrous pearls; but if the air and the sunlight are not received in
sufficient quantities, the pearls do not attain perfection and are faulty
in form, color, and luster. However remarkable and even absurd this
may seem at present, it appears to have been universally accepted for
centuries by the most learned men of Europe as well as by primitive
people who delight in the mystical and fantastic. This opinion was
recorded in the Sanskrit books of the Brahmans and in other oriental
literature. The classical and medieval writings of Europe contain
numerous references to it; and it is found even yet in the traditions
and folk-lore of some peoples.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the first century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, Pliny wrote in his “Historia naturalis,” according
to Dr. Philemon Holland’s quaint translation:</p>

<p class='c020'>The fruit of these shell fishes are the Pearles, better or worse, great or
small, according to the qualitie and quantitie of the dew which they received.
For if the dew were pure and cleare which went into them, then are the
Pearles white, faire, and Orient; but if grosse and troubled, the Pearles
likewise are dimme, foule, and duskish; pale they are, if the weather were
close, darke and threatening raine in the time of their conception. Whereby
(no doubt) it is apparent and plaine, that they participate more of the aire
and sky, than of the water and the sea; for according as the morning is
faire, so are they cleere: but otherwise, if it were misty and cloudy, they
also will be thicke and muddy in colour. If they may have their full time
and season to feed, the Pearles likewise will thrive and grow bigge: but if
in the time it chance to lighten, then they close their shells together, and for
want of nourishment are kept hungrie and fasting, and so the pearles keepe
at a stay and prosper not accordingly. But if it thunder withall, then suddenly
they shut hard at once, and breed only those excrescences which be
called <i>Physemata</i>, like unto bladders puft up and hooved with wind, no
corporal substance at all: and these are the abortive &amp; untimely fruits of these
shell fishes.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c017'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Pliny’s views were probably derived from the ancient authorities of
his time, particularly from Megasthenes, Chares of Mytilene, and Isidorus of Charace; and these curious fictions were incorporated by subsequent
writers and influenced popular opinion for many centuries.
With scarcely a single exception, every recorded theory from the first
century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> to the fifteenth century evidences a belief in dew-formed
pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>This theory is referred to by Thomas Moore in his well-known lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And precious the tear as that rain from the sky,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which turns into pearls as it falls in the sea.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The Spanish-Hebrew traveler Benjamin of Tudela, in his “Masaoth”
in Persia (from 1160 to 1173), wrote: “In these places pearls
are found, made by the wonderful artifice of nature: for on the four
and twentieth day of the month Nisan, a certain dew falleth into the
waters, which being sucked in by the oysters, they immediately sink
to the bottom of the sea; afterwards, about the middle of the month
Tisri, men descend to the bottom of the sea, and, by the help of cords,
these men bringing up the oysters in great quantities from thence,
open and take out of them the pearls.”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c017'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>From the “Bustan,” one of the most popular works of Sadi, the
Persian poet (1190–1291 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>), Davie quotes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>From the cloud there descended a droplet of rain;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas ashamed when it saw the expanse of the main,</div>
      <div class='line'>Saying: “Who may I be, where the sea has its run?</div>
      <div class='line'>If the sea has existence, I, truly, have none!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Since in its own eyes the drop humble appeared,</div>
      <div class='line'>In its bosom, a shell with its life the drop reared;</div>
      <div class='line'>The sky brought the work with success to a close,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a famed royal pearl from the rain-drop arose.</div>
      <div class='line'>Because it was humble it excellence gained;</div>
      <div class='line'>Patiently waiting till success was attained.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Even the usually well-informed William Camden (1551–1623), in
whose honor the Camden Historical Society of England was named,
accepted the theory of dew-formed pearls. He stated that the river
Conway in Wales “breeds a kind of shells, which being pregnated with
dew, produce pearl.”<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c017'><sup>[42]</sup></a> Also, speaking of the Irt in county Cumberland,
England, he said: “In this brook, the shell-fish, eagerly sucking
in the dew, conceive and bring forth pearls, or (to use the poet’s word)
shell berries (<i>Baccas concheas</i>).”<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c017'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A recent letter from the American consul at Aden indicates that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>view is held even yet by the Arabs of that region. In giving their explanation
for the present scarcity in the Red Sea, he states: “There is
a belief among them that a pearl is formed from a drop of rain caught
in the mouth of the pearl-oyster, which by some chemical process after
a time turns into a pearl; and as there has been very little rain in that
region for several years past, there are few pearls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So firmly established throughout Europe was the belief in dew-formed
pearls, that its non-acceptance by the native Indians of America
excited the commiseration of the Italian historian Peter Martyr,
in his “De Orbe Novo,” one of the very first books on America, published
in 1517. He states: “But that they [pearls of Margarita Island
on the present coast of Venezuela] become white by the clearnesse of
the morning dewe, or waxe yelowe in troubled weather, or otherwise
that they seeme to rejoice in fayre weather and dear ayre, or contrary-wise,
to be as it were astonished and dymme in thunder and tempests,
with such other, the perfect knowledge hereof is not to be looked for
at the hands of these unlearned men, which handle the matter but
grossly and enquire no further than occasion serveth.”<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c017'><sup>[44]</sup></a> Peter Martyr
was distinguished for his learning, was an instructor at the court
of Spain at the height of its power, and came in contact with the most
enlightened men of Europe, consequently it may be assumed that he
reflected the best opinions of his time.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long before the aborigines of America were not alone in
discrediting the views which had prevailed in Europe for more than
fifteen hundred years. That practical old sailor Sir Richard Hawkins
concluded that this must be “some old philosopher’s conceit, for it can
not be made probable how the dew should come into the oyster.”<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c017'><sup>[45]</sup></a> A
similar view is expressed by Urbain Chauveton in his edition of Girolamo
Benzoni’s “Historia del Mondo Nuovo,” published at Geneva in
1578. From his reference to pearl-oysters on the Venezuelan coast,
we translate:</p>

</div>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Around the island of Cubagua and elsewhere on the eastern coast, are
sandy places where the pearl-oysters grow. They produce their eggs in very
large quantities and likewise pearls at the same time. But it is necessary to
have patience to let them grow and mature to perfection. They are soft
at the beginning like the roe of fish; and as the mollusk gradually grows,
they grow also and slowly harden. Sometimes many are found in one shell,
which are hard and small, like gravel. Persons who have seen them while
fishing say that they are soft as long as they are in the sea, and that the
hardness comes to them only when they are out of the water. Pliny says as
much, speaking of the Orientals in Book IX, of his Natural History, ch. 35.
But as to that author and Albert the Great and other writers upon the generation
of pearls, who have said that the oysters conceive them by means of the
dew which they suck in, and that according as the dew is clear or cloudy the
pearls also are translucent or dark, etc., etc.,—all this is a little difficult to
believe; for daily observation shows that all the pearls found in the same
shell are not of the same excellence, nor of the same form, the same perfection
of color, nor the same size, as they would or must be if they were conceived
by the dew all at one time. Besides this, in many of the islands the Indians
go fishing for them in ten or twelve fathoms depth, and in some cases they
are so firmly attached to the rocks in the sea that they can be wrenched off
only by main strength. Would it not be difficult for them to inhale the
quintessence of the air there? It seems then that it is the germ and the
most noble part of the eggs of the oyster which are converted into pearls
rather than any other thing; and the diversities of size, color, and other
qualities, proceed from the fact that some are more advanced than others,
as we see eggs in the body of the hen.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c017'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The old theory of dew-formed pearls was illustrated even as late as
1684 on a medal struck in honor of Elena Piscopia of the Corraro
family of Venice. This bore an oyster-shell open and receiving drops
of dew, and underneath was engraved the motto “<i>Rore divino</i>” (By
divine dew). Even yet one hears occasionally from out-of-the-way
places—as in the instance reported by the American consul at Aden—of
pearls formed from rain or dew, notwithstanding that there seems
to exist absolutely no justification for it in scientific zoölogy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Probably the most popular theory entertained from the fifteenth to
the seventeenth century was that pearls were formed from the eggs
of the oyster. This was intimated by Chauveton in the quotation above
given, and it was also referred to by many naturalists.</p>

<p class='c013'>In an interesting letter, dated Dec. 1, 1673, and giving as his authority
the testimony of an eye-witness, “Henricus Arnoldi, an ingenious
and veracious Dane,” Christopher Sandius wrote: “Pearl shells in
Norway do breed in sweet waters; their shells are like mussels, but
larger; the fish is like an oyster, it produces clusters of eggs; these,
when ripe, are cast out and become like those that cast them; but sometimes
it appears that one or two of these eggs stick fast to the side of
the matrix, and are not voided with the rest. These are fed by the
oyster against her will and they do grow, according to the length of
time, into pearls of different bigness.”<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c017'><sup>[47]</sup></a> This possibly hit the mark
with greater accuracy than the observations of the “ingenious and
veracious Dane” warranted, for he seems to have had quite a different
idea as to the manner in which the pearls are “fed by the oyster against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>her will” from those generally entertained by naturalists at the present
time.</p>

<p class='c013'>However, Oliver Goldsmith settled the matter by declaring briefly:
“Whether pearls be a disease or an accident in the animal is scarce
worth enquiry.”<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c017'><sup>[48]</sup></a> Thus it seems that notwithstanding all that had
been written and the extended attention given to the subject, theory
prevailed to the almost complete exclusion of practical investigation,
with little intelligent advance over Topsy’s “’spect they just growed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Owing, doubtless, to the scarcity of pearl-bearing mollusks in their
vicinities, naturalists of Europe were somewhat slow in giving attention
to the origin of pearls. This is further accounted for by the fact
that the gems occur more frequently in old and diseased shells than
in the choice specimens which have naturally attracted the notice of
conchologists.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the first of the original observations made on this subject
was that by Rondelet, who, in 1554, advanced the idea that pearls are
diseased concretions occurring in the mollusca, similar to the morbid
calculi in the mammalia.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c017'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The first writer to intimate the similarity in structural material or
substance between pearls and the interior of the shell in which they are
formed, appears to have been Anselmus de Boot (<i>circa</i> 1600), who
wrote that the pearls “are generated in the body of the creature of the
same humour of which the shell is formed;&nbsp;... for whenever the
little creature is ill and hath not strength enough to belch up or expel
this humour which sticketh in the body, it becometh the rudiments of
the pearl; to which new humour, being added and assimilated into the
same nature, begets a new skin, the continued addition of which generates
a pearl.”<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c017'><sup>[50]</sup></a> The Portuguese traveler, Pedro Teixeira (1608),
stated: “I hold it for certain that pearls are born of and formed of the
very matter of the shell and of nothing else. This is supported by the
great resemblance of the pearl and the oyster-shell in substance and
color. Further, whatever oyster contains pearls has the flesh unsound
and almost rotten in the parts where the pearls are produced, and
those oysters that have no pearls are sound and clean fleshed.”<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c017'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Somewhat more than one hundred years later, this theory was confirmed
by investigations made by the famous physicist Réaumur
(1683–1757). Microscopic examination of cross sections of pearls
show that they are built up of concentric laminæ similar, except in
curvature, to those forming the nacreous portion of the shell. In a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>paper published by the French Academy of Science in 1717,<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c017'><sup>[52]</sup></a> Réaumur
noted this condition, and suggested that pearls are misplaced pieces of
organized shell, and are formed from a secretion which overflows from
the shell-forming organ or from a ruptured vessel connected therewith,
and that the rupture or overflow is ordinarily produced by the
intrusion of some foreign or irritating substance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Edwin Arnold calls attention to this theory in his beautiful lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Know you, perchance, how that poor formless wretch—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Oyster—gems his shallow moonlit chalice?</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the shell irks him, or the sea-sand frets,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He sheds this lovely lustre on his grief.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In pursuance of this idea, we find, in 1761, the Swedish naturalist
Linnæus, “the father of natural history,” experimenting in the artificial
production of pearls by the introduction of foreign bodies in the
shell, and meeting with some degree of success. His discovery was
rated so highly that it has been announced by some writers as the reason
why the great naturalist received the patent of nobility, which is
generally supposed to have been the reward for his services to science.</p>

<p class='c013'>It seems that Linnæus’s discovery but verified the old saying that
there is nothing new under the sun, for later it was announced<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c017'><sup>[53]</sup></a> that
in China—where so many inventions have originated—this idea had
been put to practical account for centuries preceding, and the crafty
Chinaman had succeeded in producing not only small pearly objects,
but even images of Buddha, with which to awe the disciples of that
deified teacher.</p>

<p class='c013'>The method consisted in slightly opening or boring through the
shell of the living mollusk and introducing against the soft body a
small piece of nacre, molded metal, or other foreign matter. The irritation
causes the formation of pearly layers about the foreign body,
resulting, in the course of months or of years, in a pearl-like growth.
While these have some value as objects of curiosity or of slight beauty,
they are not choice pearls, nor for that matter were those produced by
Linnæus.</p>

<p class='c013'>It will be observed that the theory of Réaumur, and also that of Linnæus,
required the intrusion of some hard substance, such as a grain of
sand, a particle of shell, etc., to constitute a nucleus of the pearl; and
this is the accepted explanation at the present time as to the origin
of many of the baroque or irregular pearls, and likewise the pearly
“blisters” and excrescences attached to the shell. But not so as to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>choice or gem pearls, those beautiful symmetrical objects of great
luster which are usually referred to in speaking of pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Examinations of many of these have failed, except in rare instances,
to reveal a foreign nucleus of sand or similar inorganic substance. In
searching many fresh-water mussels, Sir Everard Home frequently
met with small pearls in the ovarium, and he further noticed that these,
as well as oriental pearls, when split into halves, often showed a brilliant
cell in the center, about equal in size to the ova of the same mollusk.
From these observations, in 1826 he deduced his “abortive ova”
theory, and announced:</p>

<p class='c020'>A pearl is formed upon the external surface of an ovum, which, having
been blighted, does not pass with the others into the oviduct, but remains attached
to its pedicle in the ovarium, and in the following season receives a
coat of nacre at the same time that the internal surface of the shell receives
its annual supply. This conclusion is verified by some pearls being spherical,
others having a pyramidal form, from the pedicle having received a coat of
nacre as well as the ovum.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c017'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Naturalists generally accepted these conclusions, that pearls originate
in pathological secretions formed, either as the result of the
intrusion of hard substances, or by the encysting or covering of ova or
other objects of internal origin; and there was no important cleavage
of opinion until the development of the parasitic theory, as a result of
the researches of the Italian naturalist Filippi, and those following his
line of investigations. This theory is not severely in conflict with
those of Réaumur, Linnæus, Home, etc., but relates principally to the
identity of the irritating or stimulating substance which forms the
nucleus of the pearl.</p>

<p class='c013'>In examining a species of fresh-water mussel, the <i>Anodonta cygnea</i>,
occurring in ponds near Turin, and especially the many small pearly
formations therein, Filippi observed that these were associated with
the presence of a trematode or parasitic worm, which he named <i>Distomum
duplicatum</i>, and which appears to be closely allied to the parasite
which causes the fatal “rot” or distemper in sheep. Under the microscope,
the smallest and presumably the youngest of these pearls showed
organic nuclei which appeared undoubtedly to be the remnants of the
trematode. In Anodonta from other regions, which were not infested
with the distoma, pearls were very rarely found by Filippi. In a
paper,<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c017'><sup>[55]</sup></a> published in 1852, containing a summary of his observations,
he concluded that a leading, if not the principal, cause of pearl-formation in those mussels was the parasite above noted; and in later papers<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c017'><sup>[56]</sup></a>
he included such other forms as <i>Atax ypsilophorus</i> within the list of
parasitic agencies which might excite the pearl-forming secretions,
comparing their action to that of the formation of plant-galls.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>The discovery of the parasitic origin of pearls was extended to
the pearl-oysters and to other parasites by Küchenmeister<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c017'><sup>[57]</sup></a> in 1856, by
Möbius<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c017'><sup>[58]</sup></a> in 1857, and by several other investigators. Prominent
among these were E. F. Kelaart and his assistant Humbert, who, in
1859<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c017'><sup>[59]</sup></a> disclosed the important relation which the presence of vermean
parasites bears to the origin of pearls in the Ceylon oysters. These
naturalists found “in addition to the Filaria and Cercaria, three other
parasitical worms infesting the viscera and other parts of the pearl-oyster.
We both agree that these worms play an important part in
the formation of pearls.” Dr. Kelaart likewise found eggs from the
ovarium of the oyster coated with nacre and forming pearls, and also
suggested that the silicious internal skeletons of microscopic diatoms
might possibly permeate the mantle and become the nuclei of pearls.
Unfortunately, Dr. Kelaart’s investigations were terminated by his
death a few months thereafter.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1871, Garner ascribed the occurrence of pearls in the common
English mussel (<i>Mytilus edulis</i>) to the presence of distomid larvæ.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c017'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
Giard,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c017'><sup>[61]</sup></a> and other French zoölogists, made similar discoveries in the
case of Donax and some other bivalves. In 1901, Raphael Dubois confirmed
the observations of Garner, associating the production of
pearls in the edible mussels on the French coasts with the presence of
larvæ of a parasite, to which he gave the name of <i>Distomum margaritarum</i>,
and boldly announced: “La plus belle perle n’est donc, en définitive,
que le brillant sarcophage d’un ver.”<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c017'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Prof. H. L. Jameson, in 1902, disclosed the relation which exists between
pearls in English mussels (<i>Mytilus</i>) and the larvæ of <i>Distomum
somateriæ</i>.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c017'><sup>[63]</sup></a> The life history of this trematode, as revealed by Dr.
Jameson, is especially interesting from a biological standpoint, since it
is entertained by three hosts at different times: the first host is a member
of the duck family; the second is the Tapes clam (<i>Tapes decussatus</i>),
or perhaps the common cockle (<i>Cardium edule</i>), which incloses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the first larval stage, and the third is the edible mussel, in which the
second larval stage of the parasite stimulates the formation of pearls.
At the Brighton Aquarium and the Fish Hatchery at Kiel, Dr. Jameson
claims to have succeeded in artificially inoculating perfectly
healthy mussels with these parasites by associating them with infested
mollusks, and thereby producing small pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>From Dr. Jameson’s interesting paper we abridge the following account
of the manner in which the pearls are developed. The trematode
enters <i>Mytilus edulis</i> as a tailless cercaria, and at first may often be found
between the mantle and the shell. The larvæ, after a while, enter the
connective tissue of the mantle, where they come to rest, assuming a
spherical form, visible to the naked eye as little yellowish spots about
one half millimeter in diameter. At first the worm occupies only a space
lined by connective-tissue fibrils, but soon the tissues of the host give
rise to an epithelial layer, which lines the space and ultimately becomes
the pearl-sac. If the trematode larva completes its maximum possible
term of life, it dies, and the tissues of the body break down to form a
structureless mass which retains the form of the parasite, owing to the
rigid cuticle. In this mass arise one or more centers of calcification,
and the precipitation of carbonate of lime goes on until the whole larva
is converted into a nodule with calcospheritic structure. The granular
matter surrounding the worm, if present, also undergoes calcification.
The epithelium of the sac then begins to shed a cuticle of conchiolin,
and from this point the growth of the pearl probably takes place on
the same lines and at the same rate as the thickening of the shell.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c017'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Fully as remarkable as the observations of Dr. Jameson are the
results claimed by Professor Dubois in experimenting with a species of
pearl-oyster (<i>M. vulgaris</i>) from the Gulf of Gabes on the coast of
Tunis, where they are almost devoid of pearls, a thousand or more
shells yielding on an average only one pearl. Conveying these to the
coast of France in 1903, he there associated them with a species of
trematode-infested mussel (<i>Mytilus gallo-provincialis</i>), and after a
short period they became so infested that every three oysters yielded
an average of two pearls.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c017'><sup>[65]</sup></a> This claim has not been without criticism;
but who ever knew scientists to agree?</p>

<p class='c013'>In the pearl-oyster of the Gambier Islands (<i>M. margaritifera cumingi</i>),
Dr. L. G. Seurat found that the origin of pearls was due
to irritation caused by the embryo of a worm of the genus <i>Tylocephalum</i>,
the life of which is completed in the eagle-ray, a fish which feeds
on the pearl-oyster.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c017'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>In 1903, Prof. W. A. Herdman, who, at the instance of the colonial
government, and with the assistance of Mr. James Hornell, examined
the pearl-oyster resources of Ceylon, announced: “We have found, as
Kelaart did, that in the Ceylon pearl-oyster there are several different
kinds of worms commonly occurring as parasites, and we shall, I think,
be able to show that Cestodes, Trematodes, and Nematodes may all be
concerned in pearl formation. Unlike the case of the European mussels,
however, we find that in Ceylon the most important cause is a
larval Cestode of the Tetrarhynchus form.”<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c017'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In his investigation of the Placuna oyster in 1905, Mr. James Hornell
found that the origin of pearls was due to minute larva of the
same stage and species as that which causes the pearls in the Gulf of
Manar oyster.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c017'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The spherical larvæ of this tapeworm sometimes occur in great
abundance, and there is evidence of forty having been found in a single
pearl-oyster. Mr. Hornell states that the living worm does not induce
pearl formation, this occurring only when death overtakes it while in
certain parts of the oyster. As a consequence, pearls are more numerous
in oysters which have been long infected, where the worms are
older and more liable to die. This parasitic worm has been traced from
the pearl-oyster to the trigger-fishes, which eat the pearl-oysters, and
thence into certain large fish-eating rays, where it becomes sexually
mature and produces embryos which enter the pearl-oyster and begin
a new cycle of life-phases.</p>

<p class='c013'>It seems, therefore, that the latest conclusions of science appear entirely
favorable to the parasitic theory as explaining at least one, and
probably the most important, of the causes for the formation of pearls;
and that some truth exists in the statement that the most beautiful
pearl is only the brilliant sarcophagus of a worm. This morphological
change is not peculiar to mollusks, for in most animal bodies a cyst is
formed about in-wandering larvæ. Fortunately for lovers of the
beautiful, in the pearl-oysters the character of the cyst-wall follows
that of the interior lining of the shell, and not only simulates, but far
surpasses it in luster.</p>

<p class='c013'>While the theory that pearls are caused by the intrusion of some
unusual substance has the evidence of actual demonstration in many
instances, and is unquestionably true to a large extent, yet microscopic
examination of some pearls suggests the theory that a foreign substance
is not always essential to their formation, and that they may
originate in calcareous concretions of minute size, termed “calcospherules.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>As regards their origin, Professor Herdman classifies pearls
into three sorts: (1) “Ampullar pearls,” which are not formed within
closed sacs of the shell-secreting epithelium like the others, but lie in
pockets or ampullæ of the epidermis. The nuclei may be sand-grains
or any other foreign particles introduced through breaking or perforation
of the shell. (2) “Muscle pearls,” which are analogous to gallstones,
formed around calcospherules at or near the insertion of the
muscles. And (3) “Cyst pearls,” in which concentric layers of nacre
are deposited on cysts containing parasitic worms in the connective tissue
of the mantle and within the soft tissues of the body.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c017'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Even a particle of earth, clay, or mud may form the nucleus of a
pearl. This was illustrated a few years ago in a fine button-shaped
pearl, which was accidentally broken under normal usage and was
found to consist of a hard lump of white clay surrounded by a
relatively thin coating of nacre. More remarkable yet are the cases in
which a minute fish, a crayfish, or the frustule of a diatom has formed
the nucleus.</p>

<p class='c013'>Several instances have been described by Woodward, Gunther, Putnam,
Stearns, and others, where small fish have penetrated between
the mantle and the shell of the mollusk, and the latter has resented the
intrusion by covering the intruder with a pearly coating. In two or
three instances the secretion occurred in so short a time that the
fish suffered no appreciable decomposition, and its species is readily
identified by observation through the nacreous layer. Among the remarkable
specimens of this nature which have come under our observation
are two very curious shells received in March, 1907, from the
Mexican fisheries. One of these specimens shows an encysted fish, so
quickly covered and so perfectly preserved that even the scales and
small bones are in evidence; indeed, one can almost detect the gloss on
the scales of the fish; and in the other—with a remarkable comet-like
appearance—a piece of ribbed seaweed is apparently the object
covered.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the foregoing, it appears that the pearl is not a product of
health associated with undisturbed conditions, but results from a
derangement in the normal state of the mollusk. Unable to resist, to
rid itself of the opposing evil, it exercises the powers given to it by a
beneficent Creator and converts the pain into perfection, the grief
into glory. Nature has many instances of the humble and lowly raised
to high degree, but none more strikingly beautiful than this. One of
the lowest of earth’s creatures, suffering a misfortune, furnishes a
wonderful lesson upon the uses of pain and adversity by converting
its affliction into a precious gem symbolical of all that is pure and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>beautiful. As written by a forgotten poet: “Forasmuch as the pearl
is a product of life, which from an inward trouble and from a fault
produces purity and perfection, it is preferred; for in nothing does
God so much delight as in tenderness and lustre born of trouble and
repentance.” As the great Persian poet Hafiz says:</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>As Kadir Munshi says, “pearls have no pedigree”; their beauty
is not to be traced to their origin, but exists wholly in the
excellence of the surroundings in which they develop.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearl-bearing mollusks are luxurious creatures, and
for the purpose of protecting their delicate bodies they cover the interior
of their shells with a smooth lustrous material, dyed with rainbow
hues, and possessing a beautiful but subdued opalescence. No
matter how foul, how coral covered, or overgrown with sponges or
seaweeds the exterior may be, all is clean and beautiful within. This
material is nacre or mother-of-pearl. It consists ordinarily of an
accumulation of extremely thin semi-transparent films or laminæ of a
granular organic substance called conchiolin, with the interstices
filled with calcareous matter. The nacre decreases in thickness from
the hinge toward the lip of the shell, and terminates a short distance
from the extreme edge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Next to the nacre is the middle layer or the shell proper. In species of
<i>Margaritifera</i>, this stratum is commonly formed of layers of calcareous
prisms arranged vertically to the shell surface. External to this
middle or prismatic layer is the epidermis or periostracum, the rough
outer coating of varying shades, usually yellow or brown. Where the
waves are rough, and the bottom hard and rocky, this covering is thick
and heavy, to afford greater protection; but where the waters are
smooth and gentle, and the bottom free from rocks, Nature—never
working in vain—furnishes only thin sides and slight defense. As is
the case with the nacre, the prismatic layer and the periostracum decrease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>in thickness from the hinge to the edge, and the inside lip of the
shell shows the gradual union of the three superimposed layers. The
two outer layers are formed by the thick edge of the mantle, the remaining
portion—or nearly the entire surface—of this organ secretes
the nacral layer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not only is the interior of the shell made lustrous and beautiful, but
this tendency is exerted toward all objects that come in contact with
the soft body of the mollusk, either by intrusion simply within the
shell, or deeply within the organs and tissues of the animal itself. All
foreign bodies—such as small parasites, diatoms, minute pebbles, etc.,—irritate
the tender tissues of the mollusk, and stimulate the pearly
formation which in course of time covers them. At first the nacreous
covering is very thin; but with added layer after layer the thickness is
enhanced, and the size of the object increases as long as it remains
undisturbed and the mollusk is in healthful growth.</p>

<p class='c013'>Chemically considered, aside from the nucleus, the structure of
pearls is identical in composition with that of the nacre of the shell in
which they are formed. Analyses have shown that those from the
fresh-water mussels of England and Scotland, and from the pearl-oysters
of Australia and of Ceylon, have nearly identical composition
in the proportion of about 5.94 per cent. of organic matter, 2.34 of
water, and 91.72 per cent. of carbonate of lime.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c017'><sup>[70]</sup></a> The specific gravity
ranges from nearly 2 to about 2.75, increasing with the deposit of the
nacreous coatings. The following summary by Von Hessling<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c017'><sup>[71]</sup></a> shows

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>The distinctive characteristic, the great beauty of a true pearl, is its
luster or orient, which is a subdued iridescence, rather than the
glittering brilliance of the diamond; and unless the shelly growth be
lustrous it does not rank as a gem pearl, no matter how perfect its
form or beautiful its color. This luster is due to the structural arrangement
of the surface as well as to the quality of the material. The
nacreous material forming true pearls, and likewise mother-of-pearl,
is commonly deposited in irregular tenuous layers, very thin and very
small in area compared with the surface of the pearl. These laminæ
overlap one another, the surfaces are microscopically crumpled and
corrugated, and the edges form serrated outlines. The greater the
angle which the laminæ form with the surface, the closer will be these
serrated outlines, and where the plane of the exterior lamina is parallel
with the plane of the surface the lines are not present. This arrangement
causes the waves of light to be reflected from different levels on
the surface, just as in a soap bubble, and the minute prisms split the
rays up into their colored constituents, producing the chromatic or iridescent
effect.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cause is wholly mechanical, and an impression of the surface
made in very fine wax shows a similar iridescence. Also, if a piece
of mother-of-pearl be immersed in acid until the surface lime or shelly
matter is dissolved, the pellucid membrane shows the iridescence until
it is so compressed that the corrugations are reduced. About two
score years ago an Englishman invented steel buttons with similar
minute corrugations producing pearly effect, but the manufacture was
unprofitable, owing, principally, to their liability to tarnish.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the shells of some mollusks—as the edible oysters (<i>Ostrea</i>) or
the giant clam (<i>Tridacna</i>),—there is almost a total absence of the
crumpled corrugated laminæ, and, consequently, there is little luster.
In others the nacre is of better quality, resulting in superior orient,
and it probably reaches its highest degree of perfection in the pearl-oyster
(<i>Margaritifera</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>As the curvature of the surface of pearls is greater, and the minute
striæ are more numerous, than in ordinary mother-of-pearl, it follows
that the iridescence is likewise greater.</p>

<p class='c013'>Superior nacre is more or less translucent, depending on its quality;
and to the iridescence of the outer laminæ is added that of many interior
ones, so that the luster is vastly increased. The position of the
pearl within the shell may greatly affect the quality of the material
and, consequently, the orient. The choicest are commonly found
within the soft parts of the animal, and those of poorer quality are at
the edges of the mantle, or within the fibers of the adductor muscle of
bivalves.</p>

<p class='c013'>The structure of pearls may be studied by examining thin cross sections
under the microscope, or by transmitted polarized light. It appears
that ordinarily a pearl is made up of many independent laminæ
superimposed one upon another “like the layers of an onion,” or,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>rather, resembling the leaves near the upper part of a well formed cabbage.
When subjected to sufficient heat, the laminæ separate from
each other, as do shells of edible oysters and similar mollusks under like
conditions. When broken by a hammer, a pearl may exhibit this laminated
formation. If not split directly through the center, the central
section may retain the spherical form; and as this commonly remains
attached to one of the parts, its concave impression appears in the other
portion of the broken pearl. The outer laminæ of many pearls may be
removed with a fair prospect of finding a good subjacent surface, and
this may be continued until the size is greatly reduced. These laminæ
are not always similar in color or luster.</p>

<p class='c013'>However, not all pearls are laminated in this manner. Instead of
superimposed layers, some of them exhibit a crystalline form, composed
of beautiful prismatic crystals radiating from the center to the
circumference. In at least one oriental pearl examined, these crystals
were in well defined arcs, and were further separated into concentric
rings of different degrees of thickness, depth of color, and distance
apart. Another specimen—a Scotch pearl—combined in separate
layers both the laminated form and the crystalline structure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Harley points out that some crystalline pearls apparently originate
in mere coalescences of mineral particles, rather than in well defined
nuclei.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c017'><sup>[72]</sup></a> Microscopic sections of crystalline pearls convey the
idea that the prisms branch and interlace with one another, and also
that in some instances they are of fusiform shape. However, these appearances
seem to be due simply to the cross sections having cut the
prisms at different angles.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls showing these types were exhibited at a meeting of the
Royal Society of London, June 8, 1887. That exhibit also contained
a section of a west Australian pearl of curiously complex crystalline
formation; instead of one central starting-point, it had more than a
dozen scattered about, from which the crystalline prisms radiated in all
directions.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since the three superimposed layers of the shell are secreted by
separate parts of the mantle, <i>viz.</i>, the nacre by the general surface, the
prismatic layer by the inner edge, and the epidermis by the outer edge,
it follows that if a pearl in course of formation is moved from one of
these distinctive portions of the palial organ to another, the nature of
its laminæ changes. Thus, if a pearl formed on the broad surface of
the mantle is moved in some way to the inner edge of that organ, it
may be covered with a prismatic layer; if then moved to the outer
edge it may receive a lamina of epidermis, and then by changing again
to the broad surface of the mantle it receives further coats of nacre.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>The structure of pearls from univalve mollusks, such as the conch,
the abalone, etc., as well as those from some bivalves, as the Pinna,
for instance, differs from that of the true pearls formed in species
of Margaritifera. Instead of the alternate layers of conchiolin and of
carbonate of lime, many of these have an alveolar structure. When
greatly magnified, the surface of a Pinna pearl appears to be formed of
very small polygones, which, as decalcification shows, are the bases of
small pyramids radiating from the nucleus. The walls of these pyramids
are formed of conchiolin, and they are filled with carbonate of
lime of a prismatic crystalline structure. This is simply a modification
of the parallel laminæ in the Margaritifera pearls, for, as Dubois
points out, in some sections we can see portions where the alveolar
formation has proceeded for a time coincidentally with the lamellar
form.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls are affected by acids and fetid gases, and may be calcined
on exposure to heat. Their solubility in vinegar was referred to by
the Roman architect Vitruvius (“De Architectura,” L. viii. c. 3) and
also by Pausanias, a Greek geographer in the second century (“Hellados
Periegesis,” L. viii, c. 18); but it seems that there could be little
foundation for Pliny’s well-known anecdote in which Cleopatra is
credited with dissolving a magnificent pearl in vinegar and drinking it—“the
ransom of a kingdom at a draught”—to the health of her lover
Antony.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c017'><sup>[73]</sup></a> It is no more easy to dissolve a pearl in vinegar than it is to
dissolve a pearl-button—for the composition is similar, and one may
easily experiment for himself as to the difficulty in doing this. Not
only does it take many days to dissolve in cold vinegar the mineral
elements of a pearl of fair size, but even with boiling vinegar it requires
several hours to extract the mineral matter from one four or
five grains in weight, the acid penetrating to the interior very slowly.
And in neither case can the pearl be made to disappear, for even after
the carbonate of lime has dissolved, the organic matrix of animal matter—which
is insoluble in vinegar—retains almost the identical shape,
size, and appearance as before. If the pearl is first pulverized, it becomes
readily soluble in vinegar, and might be thus drunk as a lover’s
potion, but it would scarcely prove a <i>bonne bouche</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls assume an almost infinite variety of forms, due largely to
the shapes of the nuclei, and also to their positions within the mollusk.
The most usual—and, fortunately, also the most valuable—is the
spherical, resulting from a very minute or a round body as a nucleus
and the uniform addition of nacre on all sides. Of course, spherical
pearls can result only where they are quite free from other hard substances;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>consequently they originate only in the soft parts of the mollusk
and not by the fixation of some nucleus to the interior surface of
the shell.</p>

<p class='c013'>The perfectly spherical pearls range in weight from a small fraction
of a grain to three hundred grains or more, but it is very, very rare
that one of choice luster weighs more than one hundred grains. The
largest of which we have any specific information was that among the
French crown jewels as early as the time of Napoleon, an egg-shaped
pearl, weighing 337 grains. The largest pearl known to Pliny in the
first century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> weighed “half a Roman ounce and one scruple over,”
or 234½ grains Troy. These very large ones, weighing in excess of
one hundred grains, are called “paragons.” The small pearls—weighing
less than half a grain each—are known as “seed-pearls.” The
very small ones, weighing less than <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>25</sub> of a grain, are called “dust-pearls.”
These are too small to be of economic value as ornaments.</p>

<p class='c013'>Slight departures from the perfect sphere, result in egg shapes, pear
shapes, drop shapes, pendeloque, button shapes, etc. Some of these are
valued quite as highly at the present time as the spherical pearls, and
many of the most highly prized pearls in the world are of other than
spherical form. Indeed, pearls of this kind are found of larger size
than the perfectly round pearls. The egg-shaped pearl,<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c017'><sup>[74]</sup></a> called “la
Régente,”—one of the French crown jewels sold in May, 1887—weighed,
as stated above, 337 grains. The great pear pearl described by
Tavernier—“the largest ever discovered”—weighed about 500 grains.
A button pearl received from Panama in 1906 weighed 216 grains.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wider departures from the spherical form result in cylindrical,
conical, top-shaped, etc. Some pearls present the appearance of having
been turned in a lathe with intricate tooling. Remarkable examples
of these “turned pearls” have been found, competing in their
circular perfection with the best work of a jeweler’s lathe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many standard varieties of non-spherical, but normally shaped
pearls, are recognized by the fishermen and the jewelers. For instance,
in the nomenclature of the American fishermen, <i>bouton</i>, or button
pearls are divided into “haystacks” and “turtle-backs,” according
to the height of the projection. Also, certain imperfections result in
distinguishing names: “bird’s-eye” refers to a pearl having a little imperfection
on the best surface; “ring-arounds” have a dark or discolored
ring about them; and “strawberries” have numerous minute
projections on the surface.</p>

<p class='c013'>During its growth, a spherical pearl may come in contact with a
foreign body, such as grit or a vegetable film, and the additional nacral
layers envelop the adjacent matter until it is entirely concealed within
the pearl, its position being recognized only by the excrescence on one
side, and, with continued increase in size, even this may be almost
overcome.</p>

<p>ACTUAL SIZES OF PEARLS FROM ⅛ GRAIN TO 160 GRAINS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Sometimes double, triple, or multiple pearls are formed; each of
these may have a separate nucleus and grow independently for a time
until they adjoin each other; continuing to grow, they become so united
as to form a connected mass. The “Southern Cross” is a remarkable
example of this. It appears to consist of seven nearly spherical pearls
attached to one another in a straight line, and one projecting from each
side of the second in the row, thus forming a Roman cross.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c017'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A few years ago, near Sharks Bay, on the coast of western Australia,
a cluster was found containing about 150 pearls closely compacted.
This cluster measured about one and a half inches in length, three
quarters of an inch in breadth, and half an inch in thickness.</p>

<p class='c013'>When a growing pearl is very near to the nacreous lining of the
shell, the pressure between the two hard substances results in a rupture
of the pearl-forming sac and the epithelial layer of the shell, and the
pearl comes in actual contact with the nacre. The pearl gradually
becomes attached to the shell, and the under portion is prevented from
growing further; the upper or exposed surface receives other layers,
resulting in the formation of a <i>bouton</i>. As the shell around the
pearl continues to grow, it gradually closes about, and almost wholly
conceals the pearl. Since it is constantly wasting away on the exterior
surface as it grows on the interior, it follows that in time the shell
passes the pearl quite through to the outside, where it rapidly decays.
Thus the oyster virtually forces the annoying intruder directly
through the wall of its house instead of by way of the open door, and
magically closes the breach with its marvelous masonry.</p>

<p class='c013'>These embedded pearls are generally faulty and of diminished
luster, but in the aggregate, large quantities of imperfect ones, and
especially half and quarter pearls, are secured in this manner. Sometimes—particularly
in the Australian fisheries—large pearls are thus
found, weighing twenty, forty, sixty, and even eighty grains; and
when the faulty outside layers of nacre are removed, a subjacent surface
of fine luster may possibly be revealed. In bivalves, these adherent
pearls are commonly in the deep or lower valve, except in those
unusual cases where the mollusks have been lying in a reverse position.
At the fisheries, the surfaces of the shells are carefully inspected for
evidence of pearly nodules, and these are broken open in search for
encysted objects. Cutters of mother-of-pearl occasionally find embedded
pearls of this kind which have escaped the vigilant eyes of the
fishermen.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>We read of an instance in an important paper treating of the jeweling
trade of Birmingham: “A few years since [the paper was written
in 1866] a small lot of shells was brought to Birmingham, which either
from ignorance or mistake had not been cleared of the pearls at the
fishery. A considerable number were found and sold, and one especially
was sold by the man who had bought the shell for working into
buttons, for £40. The purchaser, we believe, resold the same for a
profit of £160; and we have heard that it was afterward held in Paris
for sale at £800.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A choice gem which was found in New York, in October, 1905, in
an Australian shell, sold finally for $1200.</p>

<p class='c013'>The intrusion and continued presence of grains of sand or similar
material between the mantle and the shell causes the formation of
nacre over the foreign body, resulting in a <i>chicot</i> (blister pearl), or
possibly a quarter or a half-pearl. The growth of a <i>chicot</i> sometimes
results from the mollusk covering a choice pearl which has become
loosened from the soft tissues and adheres to the shell, as above cited.
Hence, it is sometimes desirable to break a <i>chicot</i> to secure its more
valuable inclosure. In the account of his interesting pearling experiences
on the Australian coast, Henry Taunton states: “During the
first season’s shelling at Roebuck Bay, we came across an old worm-eaten
shell containing a large blister, which was removed in the usual
manner by punching a ring of minute holes around its base; a slight
tap was then sufficient to detach it. For many weeks it was untouched,
no one caring to risk opening it, for if filled with black ooze,
which is frequently the case, it would be of little value. At last, baffled
in his attempt to solve the problem, and emboldened by an overdose of
‘square face,’ the skipper gave it a smart blow with a hammer, which
cracked it open, and out rolled a huge pearl, nearly perfect, and weighing
eighty grains. A few specks and discolorations were removed by
a skilful ‘pearl-faker,’ and it was sold in London for £1500.”<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c017'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Blister pearls are also caused by the defensive or protective action
of the mollusk in resisting the intrusion of some animal, as a boring
sponge or a burrowing worm, which has begun to penetrate the outer
layers of the shell. This stimulation causes the mollusk to pile nacreous
material upon the spot, thus making a substantial mound closely
resembling a segment of a large pearl. This walling-out of intruders
is not the result of intelligent forethought or of instinct, analogous to
the repairing of a damaged web by a spider, or the retunneling of a
collapsed gallery by ants; it is a pathological rather than an intelligent
action.</p>

<p>BROOCHES MADE OF PETAL, DOG-TOOTH, AND WING PEARLS<br /><br />From the Upper Mississippi Valley</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>When the nucleus of a pearl is large and very irregular, it necessarily
follows that the deposited nacre roughly assumes the irregular outline
of the inclosed object. This is strikingly shown in pearls covering
a minute fish, a crayfish, or a small crab. Several specimens have been
found in which the species could be identified by examination through
the nacreous coating.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the American Unios there is a strong tendency to produce
elongated pearls near the hinge of the shell, which are consequently
known as “hinge pearls.” The occurrence and form of these suggest
that their origin may not be due to nuclei, but that they result from an
excess of carbonate of lime in the water, and that the animal stores a
surplus of nacre in this convenient form. There are several standard
forms of these hinge pearls. Many are elongated or dog-toothed,
some are hammer-shaped, others resemble the wings of birds, the
petals of flowers, the bodies of fish, and various other objects. A large
percentage of the pearls found in Unios of the Mississippi Valley are
of these types.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some irregular pearls or baroques are very large, weighing an ounce
or more. A well-known example is the Hope pearl, described on page
463, which weighs three ounces. These monster pearls sometimes assume
odd shapes, such as clasped hands, the body of a man, lion, or
other animal, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>Although baroques may have a pearly luster, they are not highly
prized unless unusually attractive, and they have little permanent
value, apart from their estimation in the eyes of admirers of the
curious and unique. They are used largely in <i>l’art nouveau</i>, and in
forming odd and fanciful objects of jewelry, the designer taking advantage
of the resemblance which they bear to common objects of
every-day life, and by additions of gold and other ornaments completing
the form which nature had merely suggested.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some remarkable examples of baroque mountings have been produced,
and a few are to be found in most of the large pearl collections.
In a single case in the Imperial Treasury at Vienna are baroques
forming the principal parts or figures of a horse, stag, lamb, tortoise,
lizard, cock, dragon, butterfly, gondola, hippopotamus, female bust,
and three mermaids. Other well-known collections are those of the
royal family of Saxony in the Grüne Gewölbe at Dresden; those in the
Palace of Rosenberg at Copenhagen; in the Waddesden (Rothschild)
collection of the British Museum; among the jewels in the Louvre in
Paris; with the treasures of the Basilica of St. Mark in Venice; and
in the museum of the University of Moscow.</p>

<p class='c013'>A remarkable pearl-like ornament more common in Asia than in the
Occident, is the <i>coque de perle</i>, which is an oval section of the globose
whorl of the Indian nautilus. The exterior or convex surface is highly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>lustrous, but the material is very thin. It is commonly provided with
a suitable filling or backing of putty or cement to impart solidity, and
is used like a blister pearl. Sometimes two perfectly matched <i>coques
de perle</i> are filled and cemented together, giving the appearance of an
abnormally large oblong or nearly spherical pearl.</p>

<p class='c013'>The color of pearls has no connection with the luster. In general
it is the same as that of the shell in which they are formed. Black
pearls are found in the black shells of Mexico, and pink pearls in the
pink-hued <i>Strombus</i> of the Bahamas. Ceylon pearls are seldom of any
other color than white, and Sharks Bays are almost invariably quite
yellow or straw-colored, while those of Venezuela are commonly
yellowish tinged. But from other localities, pearls simulate every tint
of the rainbow, as well as white and black. The most common, as
well as the most desirable ordinarily, is white, or rather, silvery or
moonlight glint,—“<i>la gran Margherita</i>,” as Dante calls it; but yellow,
pink, and black are numerous. They may also be piebald—a portion
white and the rest pink or brown or black. Some years ago there was
on the market a large bean-shaped pearl of great luster, one half of
which was white and the other quite black, the dividing-line being
sharply defined in the plane of the greatest circumference. The pearls
from Mexico, the South Sea islands, and the American rivers are
especially noted for their great variety of coloration, covering every
known tint and shade, and requiring such a master as Théophile Gautier
to do justice to them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many theories have been advanced to explain the coloration of
pearls. When the old idea of dew formation prevailed, it was considered
that white pearls were formed in fair weather, and the dark
ones when the weather was cloudy. It was further considered that the
color was influenced by the depth of the water in which they grew:
that in deep water they were white, but where it was so shallow that
the sunlight easily penetrated, the pearls were more likely to be dark
in color. Tavernier curiously explained that the black pearls of
Panama and Mexico owed their color to the black mud in which the
pearl-oysters of those localities lived, and that Persian Gulf pearls
were more inclined to yellow than those of Ceylon, owing to the
greater putrefaction of the flesh before they were removed therefrom.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c017'><sup>[77]</sup></a>
Two centuries ago the color of a pearl was attributed to that of the
central nucleus, and it was concluded that if the nucleus was dark, the
pearl would be of a similar hue.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c017'><sup>[78]</sup></a> This theory has also been upset, for
pearls are found white on the exterior and quite dark within, and also
with these conditions reversed.</p>

<p>GRAY PEARLS IN THE POSSESSION OF AN AMERICAN LADY AND BROOCH FROM TIFFANY &amp; CO.’S EXHIBIT, PARIS EXPOSITION, 1900</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>The color of a pearl is determined by that of the conchiolin, as
appears from its remaining unchanged after decalcification. While
generally it is the same as that of the mother-of-pearl at the corresponding
point of the shell in which it is formed, there are many exceptions
to this, and the reasons for the varying tints and colors are
probably to be found in the changes in position of the pearl, the ingredients
of the water, the health of the mollusk, accidents of various
kinds, etc. These factors will be referred to later in discussing the
pearls from different mollusks and regions; but in general it is no
more easy to explain the colors of pearls than it is to say why one rose
is white and another is yellow.</p>

<p class='c013'>Medieval writers had much to say regarding unripe or immature
pearls, likening them to eggs in the body of a hen, which follow a uniform
rate of growth; and this idea is not entirely absent even in contemporaneous
writings. However, it is an interesting fact that the
humble mollusks, like the five wise virgins with prepared lamps, keep
their gems perfect in beauty and luster at all times. It matters not
whether the pearl be removed when it is only the size of a pinhead or
not until it reaches that of a marble, it is at all times a complete, a ripe,
a perfect pearl, and the largest surpasses the smallest only in the characteristics
and properties which are incidental to size. Imparting perfection
and completion every day, every moment, the mollusk utilizes
the added time simply in enlarging its beautiful work.</p>

<p class='c013'>Although art has made wonderful progress in that direction, the
pearl, like truth, is not easily imitated. There is as much difference
between the ubiquitous imitations and the perfect gem as there is between
a chromolithograph and a silvery Corot, or between the effects
of cosmetics and the freshness of youth. While to the unskilled, or
under superficial inspection, the false has some of the properties of the
genuine, it is only necessary to place them side by side to make the
difference apparent. However clever the imitation may be in color, in
form, and in density, it always lacks in richness, in sweetness, and in
blended iridescence.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house,
as your pearl in your foul oyster.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>As You Like It</i>, Act V, sc. 4.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c027'>In geographic range, the sources of pearls are widely distributed,
each one of the six continents yielding its quota; but the places
where profitable fisheries are prosecuted are restricted in area.
First in point of value, and possibly of antiquity also, are the
fisheries of the Persian Gulf, giving employment ordinarily to thirty
thousand or more divers. The yield in the likewise ancient fisheries
of the Gulf of Manaar is uncertain, but sometimes remarkably
large. The Red Sea resources are now of slight importance compared
with their extent in the time of the Ptolemies. Other Asiatic fisheries
are in the Gulf of Aden, about Mergui Archipelago, on the coast of
China, Japan, Korea, and Siam, and also in the rivers of China, Manchuria,
and Siberia.</p>

<p class='c013'>Aside from those produced in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden,
the pearl fisheries of Africa are of small extent. Some reefs exist on
the lower coast of the German East African territory and also in Portuguese
East Africa, but they have not been thoroughly exploited.</p>

<p class='c013'>In most of the inshore waters of Australasia pearls may be secured;
the fisheries are most extensive on the northern coast of Australia, in
the Sulu Archipelago, and about the Dutch East Indies. Tuamotu
Archipelago, Gambier, Fiji, and Penrhyn are prominent in the South
Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the seas of Europe few pearls have been found, but the rivers
have yielded many; and although the resources have been greatly impaired,
many beautiful gems are yet found there.</p>

<p class='c013'>South America contributes the important reefs on the coast of
Venezuela—the land of unrest and revolutions, whose fisheries were
first exploited by Columbus. Other South American countries in
which pearls are collected are Panama, Ecuador, Peru, etc. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>North America, pearls are found in the pearl-oyster of the Gulf of
California, the abalone of the Pacific coast, the queen conch of the
Gulf of Mexico, and in the Unios of most of the rivers, especially those
of the Mississippi Valley.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since pearly concretions partake of the characteristics of the shell
within which they are formed, it follows that practically all species of
mollusks whose shells have a well-developed nacreous lining yield
pearls to a greater or less extent. But the number of these species is
relatively small. They belong chiefly to the <i>Margaritiferæ</i>, or pearl-oyster
family of the sea, and to the <i>Unionidæ</i>, or family of fresh-water
mussels. Pearls occur also in some univalves, but not so abundantly
as in bivalves of the families mentioned. Broadly stated, we may hope
to find pearls within any mollusk whose shell possesses a nacreous surface;
and it is useless to search for them in shells whose interior is dull
and opaque, such as the edible oyster for instance.</p>

<p class='c013'>The great bulk of the pearls on the market, and likewise those of the
highest quality, are from the <i>Margaritiferæ</i>, which are widely distributed
about tropical waters. Although these mollusks are spoken of
as pearl-oysters, they are not related in any way to the edible oysters
(<i>Ostrea</i>) of America and Europe.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c017'><sup>[79]</sup></a> The flesh is fat and glutinous,
and so rank in flavor as to be almost unfit for food, although eaten at
times by the poorer fishermen in lieu of better fare. The origin of the
name is doubtless due to the fact that in the somewhat circular form
of the shell they resemble oysters rather than the elongated mussels of
Europe, to which they are more nearly related in anatomy. Also in
that—like their namesakes—they are monomyarian, having only one
adductor muscle.</p>

<p class='c013'>The two valves or sides of the pearl-oyster shell are nearly similar in
shape and almost equal in size; whereas in the edible oysters one valve
is thin and somewhat flat, while the other is thicker, larger, and highly
convex. In the latter, also, the hinge, or umbo, is an angular beak; but
in the pearl-oysters the umbo is prolonged by so-called ears or wings
into a straight line the length of which is nearly equal to the breadth
of the shell.</p>

<p class='c013'>The byssus, or bunch of fibers, by which pearl-oysters attach themselves
to the bottom indicates their relationship to the mussels. The
possession of a small foot and somewhat extended migratory powers—at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>least in the first years of growth—also distinguish them from
the sedentary edible oysters. But from an economic point of view,
the principal difference is the possession of a thick, nacreous, interior
lining in the shells of pearl-oysters, which is wholly lacking in the
edible species. Like their namesakes, the pearl-oysters are exceedingly
fertile, a single specimen numbering its annual increase by millions.</p>

<p class='c013'>Commercially considered, the pearl-oysters are roughly divisible
into two groups, (1) those fished exclusively for the pearls which
they contain, and (2) those whose shells are so thick as to give them
sufficient value to warrant their capture independently of the yield of
pearls. The best examples of the first group are the pearl-oysters of
Ceylon and of Venezuela, and to a less extent those of the Persian
Gulf, the coast of Japan, and of Sharks Bay, on the Australian coast.
Of the second group, the pearl-oysters of Torres Straits and of the
Malay Archipelago are the most prominent members. Between these
two groups are the many species and varieties whose shells and pearls
are more evenly divided with respect to value, including those of Mexico,
Panama, the Red Sea, the South Sea islands, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some conchologists recognize a large number of species of <i>Margaritiferæ</i>,
while other authorities consider many of these as local variations
of the same species. There is much difference in the size, color,
and markings of the shells in different localities, owing to varying
geographical and physical conditions. The distinction of species and
the nomenclature herein adopted are those of Dr. H. L. Jameson, who
has recently revised and rearranged the collection of shells belonging
to this family in the British Museum of Natural History,<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c017'><sup>[80]</sup></a> and to
whom we are indebted for descriptive notes relative to several of the
species.</p>

<p class='c013'>The greatest pearl-producer in the family of pearl-oysters is the
<i>Margaritifera vulgaris</i> of the Gulf of Manaar and the Persian Gulf,
and to a much less extent of the Red Sea. It occurs in various other
inshore waters of the Indian Ocean, and about the Malay Archipelago
and the coast of Australia and New Guinea, although it is not the principal
pearl-oyster of those waters. An interesting account of its
immigration into the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal was
given by Vassel in 1896.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c017'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>This species is quite small, averaging two and a half inches in
diameter in Ceylon waters, and somewhat more in the Persian Gulf,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>whence large quantities of the shell are exported under the name of
“Lingah shell.” The Ceylon variety has the nacreous lining almost
uniformly white over the entire surface, only the lip having a slightly
pinkish ground color. The exterior is marked by seven or eight reddish
brown radial bands on a pale yellow ground. In addition to its
greater size, the Persian variety is darker, and the lip of the shell has
a reddish tinge.</p>

<p class='c013'>For centuries the <i>Margaritifera vulgaris</i> has sustained the great
pearl fisheries of Ceylon, India, and Persia, and at present yields the
bulk of pearls on the market, especially the seed-pearls and also those
of medium size. It produces relatively few large ones, rarely exceeding
twelve grains in weight. These pearls are commonly silvery
white, and for their size command the highest prices, because of their
beautiful form and superior luster. Excepting the Venezuelan species,
this is the only pearl-oyster which at present supports extensive fisheries
exclusively for pearls; in the fisheries for all other species the
value of the shells furnishes considerable revenue, and in some localities
this represents several times as much as the income from the
pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ranking next to <i>Margaritifera vulgaris</i> in extent of pearl production
is the <i>Margaritifera margaritifera</i>, which is widely distributed
about the tropical inshore waters of the Pacific and Indian oceans. It
is very much larger than the Lingah oyster, good specimens measuring
seven or eight inches in diameter, and the nacreous interior is
usually of a darker color. In addition to its yield of pearls, the shell of
this species is of value in the mother-of-pearl trade, and contributes
largely to the economic results of the fisheries. Indeed, in several
regions the shell is of more value than the pearls, which represent only
an incidental yield. As Jameson notes, the color and markings of the
shell, though extremely variable, generally suffice to distinguish this
species. The ground color of the exterior ranges through various
shades from yellowish brown to very dark brown. Its characteristic
markings consist of from ten to eighteen radial rows of white and
yellow spots, running from the umbo, or hinge, to the margin.</p>

<p class='c013'>Several varieties of <i>Margaritifera margaritifera</i> are recognized.
The type species occurs along the north coast of Australia, from Brisbane
on the east to Sharks Bay on the west; on the New Guinea coast;
at Formosa; and about many of the islands of the Pacific. The well-known
“black lip shell” of Australian waters is of this species; it
shows a greenish black on the margin of the nacre. The yield of this is
very small compared with that of the large pearl-oyster of Australia.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>The <i>Margaritifera margaritifera</i> occurs on the eastern coast of
Arabia in two varieties, which differ somewhat from the type species.
These have been designated by Jameson as <i>M. margaritifera persica</i>
and <i>M. margaritifera erythræensis</i>. These are much larger than the
Lingah shell of the Persian Gulf, but are smaller than the Australian
species. The percentage of pearls in them is less than in the Lingah
species, but from a commercial point of view this is to some extent
offset by the greater value of the shell. The <i>M. m. persica</i> is more numerous
in the gulf than the <i>M. m. erythræensis</i>, and large quantities of
the shell are marketed in Europe. Formerly the shipments were made
principally by way of Bombay, hence the shell is known in the mother-of-pearl
trade as “Bombay shell.” The exterior is of a light grayish
or greenish brown color, with yellowish white radial bands. The
nacre has a slightly roseate tint, and the margin is greenish yellow.
The pearls found herein are more yellowish in color and attain a larger
size than those from the Lingah oyster.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>M. m. erythræensis</i> occurs also in the Red Sea and along the
shores of the Arabian Sea. Among mother-of-pearl dealers it is
known as “Egyptian shell” or “Alexandria shell,” owing to the fact
that prior to the opening of the Suez Canal shipments were commonly
made by way of Alexandria. The color of the nacre is darker than
that of its related variety in the Persian Gulf. In the trade, three
grades of this shell are recognized, classed according to the shade of
color. The lightest comes from Massowah and near the southern end
of the Red Sea, and the darkest from farther north, in the vicinity of
Jiddah and Suakim.</p>

<p class='c013'>The islands of the southern Pacific, and of eastern Polynesia especially,
yield another variety of <i>M. margaritifera</i>, to which the name
<i>M. m. cumingi</i> has been given. The nacre is of a dark metallic green,
and in the mother-of-pearl trade the shell is designated as “black-edged.”
It attains a large size, only slightly smaller than the large
Australian species; many individual specimens measure ten inches in
diameter, and weigh six or seven pounds for the two valves. Belonging
to this variety are those oysters whose shells are known in the
markets of Europe and America as “Tahiti,” “Gambier,” and “Auckland”
shells, the name designating the port of shipment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet another subspecies, the <i>M. m. mazatlanica</i>, occurs on the coasts
of Panama and Mexico, and especially in the Gulf of California. This
is likewise green-edged, and the exterior color is yellow or light brown.
This shell has been marketed in quantities since 1850, and is known in
the mother-of-pearl trade as “Panama shell.” It is smaller than the
Australian species, specimens rarely exceeding eight inches in diameter.
It yields a large percentage of the black pearls that have been so
fashionable in the last fifty years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since 1870, the largest pearls have been found mainly in a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>large species of pearl-oyster, <i>Margaritifera maxima</i>, obtained off the
north and west coasts of Australia, among the Sulu Islands, and elsewhere
in the Malay Archipelago. In the fisheries for this species, the
mother-of-pearl is the principal object sought, and the pearls are obtained
incidentally. It is the largest of all the members of this family,
reaching in exceptional cases twelve or thirteen inches in diameter,
and weighing upward of twelve pounds; while the Ceylon oyster rarely
exceeds four ounces in weight. So marked is this difference, that the
Australian species is often designated the “mother-of-pearl oyster,”
and the Ceylon species the “pearl-oyster.” Jameson notes that it
differs from the <i>Margaritifera margaritifera</i>, its nearest competitor
in size, in its much longer hinge, its shape, its lesser convexity, and in
its color and markings. As described by him, the color ranges from
pale yellowish brown to deep brown, with traces of radial markings of
dark brown, green, or red in the umbonal area. In its marginal region,
the shell is marked by a series of circumferential lines about one third
of a millimeter apart.</p>

<p class='c013'>Several geographical varieties of this species are recognized in the
mother-of-pearl trade, differing principally in the coloring of the interior
surface. The chief commercial varieties are “Sydney” or
“Queensland,” “Port Darwin,” “West Australian,” “New Guinea,”
“Manila,” “Macassar,” and “Mergui.” The nacre of those from the
Australian coast is almost uniformly silvery white. That of the
“Manila shell” is characterized by a broad golden border surrounding
the silvery white nacre. The “Macassar shell” lacks the golden border
of the “Manila shell,” and is similar in its uniform whiteness to the
“Sydney shell,” but its iridescence is much greater.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Margaritifera carcharium</i>, from Sharks Bay, on the coast of
Australia, yields yellow pearls and small quantities of mother-of-pearl.
This species is small—three or four inches in diameter. The color is
grayish or greenish yellow, with several somewhat indistinct radial
bands of brownish green. The nacre has a yellowish green tint, with
a margin of pale yellow, with brown markings.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the West Indies and on the Atlantic coast of tropical America,
especially the coast of Venezuela, occurs the <i>Margaritifera radiata</i>.
This species is quite small, and seems to be closely allied to the Ceylon
oyster. Like the latter, the nacreous interior is rich and brilliant, but
owing to its small size, the shell is wholly valueless as mother-of-pearl.
The principal and almost the only fishery for this species is on the
Venezuelan coast, in the vicinity of Margarita Island, the islands of
Cubagua, and Coche.</p>

<p class='c013'>The coast of Japan yields the <i>Margaritifera martensi</i>, which occurs
among the numerous islands in the southern part of the empire, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>does not extend beyond 40° north latitude. This species is likewise
small, and closely resembles the pearl-oyster of Ceylon, from which
it differs principally in coloration. As noted by Jameson, brown and
white predominate in the exterior coloring, and the interior of the lip
is marbled with yellow ocher and chocolate brown, instead of pink, as
in the Ceylon shell.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are numerous other species of pearl-oysters, but they are of
slight economic importance, and do not support fisheries of value.</p>

<p class='c013'>As only a small percentage of the individual mollusks contain
pearls, it follows that vast quantities are destroyed without any return
whatever, and handling them merely adds to the expense of the
industry, as well as reduces the resources of the reefs. This could be
obviated if it were possible, without opening them, to determine the
individual mollusks containing pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the several methods proposed for this purpose, especially
interesting is the use of X-rays, which was suggested by Raphael
Dubois of Lyons, France, in 1901.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c017'><sup>[82]</sup></a> The shells of some pearl-oysters—those
of Ceylon and of Venezuela for instance—are relatively thin,
and it was thought that by the means of the rays the presence of
pearls could be ascertained, and non-pearl-bearers could be saved from
opening, and be returned to the reefs without injury. Although the
calcareous shell partly interrupts the radiations, it is not difficult to
recognize the presence of large pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>The theory has never been found practical in application, owing
largely to the rough and irregular exterior of the shell and the small
size of the pearls. The presence of the larger pearls may be ascertained
by this method; but it is exceedingly probable that a very large
percentage of the small ones, and especially the seed-pearls, would be
overlooked. Furthermore, if in their sixth year oysters contain no
pearls, the probability of appearance therein later is very small, and
little benefit would result from their return to the water. As to saving
the trouble of opening the non-pearl-bearing mollusks, labor in the
pearling regions is usually inexpensive, and this cost is far more than
offset by the reasonable certainty of securing practically all the small
as well as the large pearls by the present method of operation. Owing
to the greater thickness and the economic value of the large pearl-oysters—as
those of Australia or of Mexico, for instance—the application
of X-rays to them is obviously impractical. However, when
pearl-oyster culture becomes a highly developed industry, with personal
ownership in those mollusks returned to the water, some method
such as this might be of great value.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls are yielded by various species of <i>Unionidæ</i> or <i>Naiades</i> occurring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>in the rivers of America, Scotland, Saxony, Bavaria, Norway,
Sweden, Russia, France, China, etc. These mollusks exist exclusively
in the fresh-water streams, lakes, and ponds, and quickly die when
submerged in salt water. The <i>Unionidæ</i> are of particular interest in
America, as it is here that this group is most abundant, and nearly
every stream east of the Rocky Mountains contains more or less of
them. The Mississippi basin abounds in Unios, or “clams,” as they
are known to the fishermen of that region, and furnishes about 400 of
the 1000 recognized species of this important family.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Unios are most abundant in clear, running water, where the
bottom is gravelly or sandy. The interiors of the shells are iridescent,
and vary greatly in tint, exhibiting many delicate shades of color from
silvery white to straw color, pink, purple, brown, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>About five hundred species of American fresh-water mussels have
been recognized by conchologists. Many of these differ from one
another so very slightly that they are scarcely distinguishable from an
examination of the shells themselves, or even from the descriptions,
and a detailed index to the complete list is of little economic importance.
The professional fishermen and the shell-buyers take the trouble
to name only the species with which they deal, which includes only
about twenty-five species, all of which are margaritiferous, though
some to a greater extent than others. In the pearling regions a popular
nomenclature exists, the names given by the fishermen having reference
to the shape, color, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>The niggerhead (<i>Quadrula ebena</i>) is the most numerous in the Mississippi,
and it is extensively used in button manufacture. The thick
shell of this species is almost round, with a black outer surface and a
pearly white interior. At maturity it averages about four inches in
diameter and four ounces in weight. Owing to its uniform whiteness
and the flatness of its surface, it is well adapted to button manufacture,
and for this purpose more than twenty thousand tons are taken
in the Mississippi Valley every year. When the fishery originated, the
niggerhead was very abundant in some places, and especially between
La Crosse and Burlington. From a single bed near New Boston,
Illinois, measuring about 200 acres in area, 7500 tons, or about 70,000,000
individual shells, were removed in three years. In 1897, a bed
of 320 acres near Muscatine furnished 500 tons, or about 4,750,000
shells. This species occasionally yields valuable pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two species of Unios, <i>Quadrula undulata</i> and <i>Q. plicata</i>, are known
among the fishermen as “three-ridges.” The former is also known as
the “blue-point” from the fact that the sharp edge is usually tinged
faint blue on the inside. Although not the best for button manufacture,
the shells yield the greatest number of pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>A species somewhat similar to the niggerhead is the bullhead (<i>Pleurobema
æsopus</i>). This shell is thick and opaque, the nacre is not so
iridescent as that of the niggerhead, nor does it yield pearls of such
good quality. These two species are not evenly distributed over the
bottom of the streams, but occur in great patches or beds, sometimes
several feet in thickness and covering many hundreds of acres. Some
of the beds are several miles in length, and they may be separated by
twenty or thirty miles in which the mollusks are so scarce that profitable
fishing can not be made; but usually the reefs are smaller and
more closely situated.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sand shells (<i>Lampsilis</i>)—of which there are several species—do
not occur in large beds, but are scattered over the sandy beaches
and sloping mud-banks. In shape they are narrow and long, adults
measuring five or six inches in length. Owing to the small waste in
cutting, due to uniformity in thickness, these shells are sold to button
manufacturers for more than the niggerhead, which in turn is more
valuable than the bullhead.</p>

<p class='c013'>The buckhorn (<i>Tritigonia verrucosa</i>) is very long and narrow; on
the dark brown exterior it is rough, as is the horn from which it takes
its name, while the interior shows a beautiful display of colors. This
is not found in beds, but lies scattered among other species. It sells at
a relatively high price—usually in excess of $20 per ton—for button
manufacture.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another species is the butterfly (<i>Plagiola securis</i>), which is very
prettily marked on the outside with faintly colored dotted stripes of
varying length. Over a background of dark yellow run black stripes
to the outer edge of the shell, with dark dots between the stripes. The
shell is small and thick, and like the sand shell and the buckhorn, is
found in small quantities. Owing to the beauty and permanency of
its luster, this shell is in demand for button manufacture, and its
pearls are often very beautiful.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other well-known species are the pancake (<i>Lampsilis alatus</i>),
the maple-leaf (<i>Quadrula wardi</i>), and hackle-back (<i>Symphynota complanata</i>).
On the Atlantic seaboard, the principal species in which
pearls have been found are <i>Unio complanata</i>; the <i>Alasmodon arcuata</i>,
which has hinge teeth, and a species of Anodon. Pearls from the
<i>Unio complanata</i> are usually smaller but more lustrous than those
from either of the other species.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the many fresh-water mussels are found some remarkable
conditions of animal life. Probably the most curious is the parasitic
stage of certain species. When hatched from the egg, each one of
these is provided with hooks or spines, by means of which it attaches
itself to the gills or fins of a swimming fish and becomes embedded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>therein. After confinement in this cyst for a period of two months
or more, the small mollusk works its way out and falls to the bottom
of the river or pond, where its development continues along lines more
conventional to molluscan life.</p>

<p class='c013'>In most of the species of Unios the sexes are separate; but it has
been determined that in some the individuals are provided with both
sets of sexual organs. It is claimed by some naturalists that certain
species may change from one sex to another; yet this does not seem to
have been positively established.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not the least interesting of the habits of the Unios is the manner in
which they “walk,” bushels of them changing their habitation in a few
hours. The shell opens slightly and the muscular tongue-like “foot”
is thrust out, and by pressure of this on the bottom, the mollusk is propelled
in a jerky, jumpy movement with more speed than one would
suppose possible for the apparently inert creature.</p>

<p class='c013'>The number of eggs produced by an individual in one season ranges
from a few hundred in some species to many millions in others, as in
the <i>Quadrula heros</i>, for instance. Most of the fresh-water mollusks
are of slow growth, reaching maturity in six or eight years, and
it is believed that if undisturbed they live to be from fifteen to fifty
years old; indeed, some writers credit them with attaining an age of
one hundred years.</p>

<p class='c013'>While outwardly there is no positive indication of the existence of
pearls, they are relatively scarce in young mollusks, and likewise in
those having a normal, healthy appearance, with smooth exterior free
from blemishes, and they are found generally in the older, irregular,
and deformed shells, which bear excrescences and the marks of having
parasites. However, some of the choicest pearls have come from
shells relatively young and apparently in perfect condition.</p>

<p class='c013'>It has been pointed out that with the fresh-water Unios there are
three indications on which the fishermen to some extent rely for determining
the presence of pearls from the outward aspects of the shell.
There are, first, the thread or elevated ridge extending from the vertex
to the edge; second, the kidney-shape of the shell, and third, the contortion
of both valves toward the middle plane of the mollusk.</p>

<p class='c013'>A single mollusk may contain several small pearls,—more than one
hundred have been found,—but in such cases usually none has commercial
value. Ordinarily only one is found in the examination of
very many shells. Of these objects it may be truthfully said that
“many are found, but few are chosen,” few that are of first quality or
are worthy of a fine necklace. In many instances, several pounds of
cheap pearls would be gladly exchanged for a choice gem weighing an
equal number of grains.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>On the Atlantic seaboard of America, the Anodontas, or “mussels,”
as they are known locally, are more numerous than the Unios. They
prefer the still waters of the ponds and lakes, rather than the swift
currents of the streams. The shell is much thinner than that of the
Unios, and it is usually not so brilliant in color and iridescence; consequently
the pearly concretions obtained from them are less lustrous.</p>

<p class='c013'>The rivers of Europe, and of Asia also, contain numbers of pearl-bearing
mussels. In many localities the yield of pearls has at times attracted
attention and produced much profit, though probably never
equaling the present extent of the Mississippi River finds. The principal
pearl-bearer of Europe is the <i>Unio margaritifera</i>, the shell of
which has been of some local importance in the manufacture of pearl
buttons. In Great Britain it is known as the pearl-mussel; in France
as the <i>moule</i> or <i>huître perlière</i>; in Germany as <i>perlenmuschel</i>; in Belgium
as <i>paarl mossel de rivieren</i>; in Denmark as <i>perle-skiael</i>; in Sweden
as <i>perlmussla</i>; in Russia as <i>schemtschuschuaja rakavina</i>, and in
Finland as <i>simpsuckan cuosi</i>. The <i>Unio margaritifera</i> likewise exists
in Siberia, and possibly elsewhere in Asia. Other species of Unio exist
there and in Mongolia, Manchuria, etc., as, for instance, <i>U. mongolicus</i>,
<i>U. dahuricus</i>, etc. A leading species in eastern China, the <i>Dipsas
plicatus</i>, has long been extensively employed in the artificial production
of pearly objects or culture pearls.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c017'><sup>[83]</sup></a> Unio pearls show less
uniformity of tints than those derived from the pearl-oysters. They
present an extended series of shades, corresponding to those on the
interior of the shells, from almost perfect white through various
tints of cream, pink, yellow, bright red, blue, green, russet, and brown.
The metallic shades are numerous, especially the steels and the coppers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Most of the members of the <i>Mytilidæ</i> family, which includes the
marine mussels, are of slight luster; and the pearly concretions found in
them are of the grade known as “druggists’ pearls,” so-called because,
formerly, they were used in a powdered form in astringent and other
medicines. However, some of these mussels on the European coast yield
pearls that are fairly lustrous. The white and the pink are most numerous,
but purple, red, bronze, and yellow are by no means uncommon.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few pearls are also obtained from the sea-wings or wing-shells
(<i>Pinna</i>), the silkworms of the sea, found in the Red Sea, the Mediterranean
Sea, the Indian Ocean, the southern coast of America, and
elsewhere. These shells are narrow at the umbo, or hinge, long, and
fan-shaped; they are generally brittle, and present a horn-like appearance.
The interior is commonly of a silvery reddish or orange-colored
hue, and this tint is imparted to the pearls. The most characteristic
feature of the <i>Pinna</i> is the thick rope of silky fibers, from four to ten,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>and sometimes twenty or more inches in length, constituting the byssus,
a remarkable provision by means of which it anchors itself to the
bottom and thus outrides the storm. Formerly the byssus was gathered
in Sicily, washed in soap and water, dried, corded, and fabricated
into gloves and similar articles of a fine texture. The finished garments
were of a beautiful golden brown color, resembling the burnished
gold on the backs of some splendid flies or beetles.</p>

<p class='c013'>The yield of <i>Pinna</i> pearls is very small. A few are obtained from
the Mediterranean, especially on the Adriatic coast. These are usually
rose-tinted or reddish in color, but of diminished orient, and inferior
in size. <i>Pinna</i> pearls are also reported from the Isle of Pines and
from New Caledonia, where they are commonly very dark, almost
black in color.</p>

<p class='c013'>The window-glass shell (<i>Placuna placenta</i>), the <i>vitre chinoise</i> of
some writers, yields a few small, irregularly shaped pearls of a dull
leaden color. It occurs in the inshore waters of the Indian and the
southwestern Pacific oceans; fisheries are prosecuted in Tablegram
Lake, near Trincomali, on the northeast coast of Ceylon; on the coast
of Borneo, especially at Pados Bay, and to a less extent in some other
localities. This mollusk is quite distinct from the true pearl-oyster,
and in adult life is devoid of the byssus, living on the muddy bottom
of the shallow waters. The shell is almost circular, the right valve
is quite flat, and the left only slightly convex. It is remarkable for
its transparency, especially in the first year of growth, when the
beating of the heart of the mollusk is visible through it. Reaching
maturity in about two years, the shell becomes white and translucent,
resembling pressed isinglass somewhat in its texture. It then
measures about six or seven inches in length, and nearly the same in
width. The outside is rough; the interior is glazed over and has a subdued
pearly luster. It is so thin and transparent that with a strong
light very coarse print can be read through it. It is commonly used
in the East Indies as a substitute for glass in windows, admitting a soft
mellow light into the room. For this purpose it is usually cut into
small rectangular or diamond-shaped pieces, about five or six square
inches in area, and these are inserted into sash frames. It forms a
good economical substitute for glass, not only in windows of native
residences, but also in lanterns and the like.</p>

<p>SHELL AND PEARLS OF THE COMMON CONCH<br /><br />(<i>Strombus gigas</i>)<br /><br />Of Florida and the West Indies</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>The giant clam (<i>Tridacna gigas</i>) of tropical waters yields a few
large opal-white symmetrical pearls, with faint luster and of little
value. The transversely oval shell of the <i>Tridacna</i>, with its great
squamous ribs, is probably the largest and heaviest in existence, single
pairs weighing upward of 500 pounds. It is found in tropical seas,
and especially in the Indian Ocean. It is much used for ornament,
particularly for fountain-basins, and for <i>bénitiers</i>, or holy-water fonts.
A beautiful pair used as <i>bénitiers</i> in the Church of St. Sulpice in Paris
is said to have been a gift of the Republic of Venice to Francis I.
There seems to be no established fishery for this mollusk, and the
pearls very rarely come on the market. About four years ago in New
York City an effort was made to market one weighing about 200
grains. The owner represented that it was a “cocoanut pearl,” and
offered to sell it for $2000; whereas its actual value was probably not
over $10 or $20, and that only for a museum collection.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls of slight luster also occur in the quahog, or hard clam
(<i>Venus mercenaria</i>), of the Atlantic coast of the United States. Although
these are rare, they are generally of good form, and some
weigh upward of eighty grains each. They are commonly of dark
color, purplish, ordinarily, but they may be white, pale lilac, brown,
and even purplish black, or black. The white ones—which so nearly
resemble ivory buttons as readily to pass for them at a casual glance—are
of little value; but fine dark ones have retailed at from $10 to $100
each. There is little demand for them, for unless the color is very good,
they possess slight beauty, lacking the orient peculiar to choice pearls.
Pearls have also been reported from the edible clam of the Pacific
coast of America.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shelly concretions are found in the edible oyster of America (<i>Ostrea
virginica</i>), as well as in that of Europe (<i>O. edulis</i>); but these are commonly
objects of personal interest or of local curiosity, rather than of
artistic or commercial value, as they are lacking in luster and iridescence.
Most of them are dull or opal-white, some are purple, and a
few are white on one side and purple on the other. As many as fifty
of these formations have been found in a single oyster. Sometimes
they are of odd appearance, suggesting the human eye or face, and
recently one was found which bore a striking resemblance to a human
skull. Notwithstanding many news items to the contrary, it is doubtful
whether the choicest pearl from an edible oyster would sell for as
high as $20 on its own merits; professional shuckers have opened
thousands of bushels of oysters without finding one which would sell
for ten cents.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among univalves, the most prominent pearl-producer is probably
the common conch or great conch (<i>Strombus gigas</i>) of the West
Indies and the Florida coast, which secretes beautiful pink pearls of
considerable value. This is one of the largest of the univalve shells,
some individuals measuring twelve inches in length, and weighing
five or six pounds. The graceful curves and the delicate tints of lovely
pink color make it exceedingly attractive. The conch abounds in the
waters of the West Indies, especially in the Bahamas, where many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>thousands are annually taken for the shell, which forms quite an
article of commerce. The flesh is esteemed as food and is also used
for bait; and it is particularly in preparing for these purposes that the
pearls are found, as no established fisheries exist for the pearls alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ear-shells or abalones (Haliotidæ) found on the coasts of California,
Japan, New Zealand, and other localities in the Pacific, secrete
pearly concretions, sometimes with fine luster, but usually of small
value. These shells resemble in general outline the form of the
human ear. Distinguishing characteristics are the flatly-spiral bowl-like
shape, and the regular series of holes in the back near the distal
margin, for the admission of water to the respiratory organs. The
holes are on the left side and parallel with the columellar lip, and
those nearest the apex close up as the shell increases in size. The
shells are rough externally, but beautifully nacreous within. In
variety and intensity of coloring, the nacre is superior to that of the
pearl-oysters, but it is not so harmonious, and it does not form so thick
and flat a layer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Abalone pearls are especially interesting on account of their brilliant
and unusual colors. Green predominates, but blue and yellow
also occur. Although commonly very small, some of the well formed
ones exceed seventy-five grains in weight, and those of irregular
shape may be very much larger. The ear-shells also produce many
irregular pearly masses. Although these are without an established
commercial value, their beautiful greenish or bluish tints adapt them
for artistic jeweled objects, such as the body of a fly or of a beetle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Similar concretions are found in species of turbos and turbinella,
especially the Indian chank (<i>Turbinella rapa</i>), which yields pink and
pale red pearls. The pearly nautilus (<i>Nautilus pompilius</i>) yields a
few yellowish pearls, especially those taken in Australian waters; but
from the paper nautilus—“the sea-born sailor of his shell canoe”—no
pearls are obtained, owing to the non-lustrous nature of the
shell.</p>

<p class='c013'>In bygone days, especially in Asia, and also to some extent in
Europe, pearls were credited as coming from many non-molluscan
sources. The Rabbis had the idea that they came also from fish, as
noted in the story of a tailor who was rewarded by finding a pearl in
one which he bought (Gen. R. xi. 5). The Raganighantu of Narahari,
a Kashmir physician of about 1240 <i>A.D.</i>, reported them as coming
from bamboos, cocoanuts, heads of elephants, bears, serpents,
whales, fish, etc.;<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c017'><sup>[84]</sup></a> although it conceded that these were deficient in
luster, which is recognized as the characteristic feature of pearls.
We understand, therefore, that this use of the word signifies only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>hard concretions of a spherical form. In the apology for his book,
prison-bound Bunyan wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A pearl may in a toad’s head dwell,</div>
      <div class='line'>And may be found in an oyster shell.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The crystal gems—the diamonds, rubies, etc.—are practically unlimited
in their longevity, existing thousands of years unchanged in
condition. Except those which have been discovered by man, the earth
contains about as many as it ever did, and it is not unreasonable to
suppose that in course of time a considerable percentage of the total
will be discovered. But in the seas as well as in the rivers, the longevity
of pearls is greatly restricted, and</p>

<p class='c018'>to run their course of existence and decay unseen and unknown.
Perishable while in the seas, almost as cereals and fruits on land, the
harvest must be gathered with promptness or it is wasted. And it
seems probable that only a small percentage of the beautiful gems
produced in the waters have gladdened the sight of man.</p>

<p class='c013'>With considerable hesitancy we have attempted to estimate the
number of persons employed in the pearl fisheries of the world, and
the aggregate local value of their catch. For two or three regions,
this is not a matter of great difficulty. For instance, the divers employed
in the Ceylon fishery are numbered each season, and the auction
sales of their catch furnish a reasonably satisfactory basis for determining
the value of the output. Likewise in Australia, Venezuela,
and some minor localities, the fishermen are numbered; but the reports
are less satisfactory as to the value of the pearls. In the Persian Gulf,
the Red Sea, the Gulf of California, and the islands of the Pacific,
where pearl-diving is a profession and a regular source of livelihood,
the number of employees is fairly constant. But in the rivers and ponds
of America, as well as of Europe and of Asia, where neither experience
nor costly equipment is required for the industry, and pearls to
the value of very many thousands of dollars are obtained by men,
women, and even children, on pleasure bent, as well as in the widely
fluctuating professional fisheries, the problem is far more difficult.</p>

<p class='c013'>Contending with these many difficulties, we venture to present the
following estimate of the number of persons employed in the pearl
fisheries of the world, and the value of the output in 1906.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our returns do not represent the annual output of pearls in the
values best known to gem buyers. The difference in price between
pearls in the fisherman’s hands in the Persian Gulf or at the Pacific
islands, and that for which they are exchanged over the counters in
New York or Paris, is nearly as great as the difference in value of
wool on the sheep’s back and of the same material woven into fashionable
fabrics. For each dollar received by the fisherman, the retail
buyer probably pays three; and it is not unreasonable to suppose that
the pearls herein represented probably sold ultimately for an aggregate
of $24,420,000.</p>

<p class='c013'>This summary falls far short in giving a correct idea of the importance
of the pearl fisheries in furnishing a livelihood to humanity;
for it takes no consideration of that great body of men who contribute
incidentally to the prosecution of the fisheries, such as shell-openers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>pearl-washers, watchmen, cooks, laborers, etc. In the Ceylon pearl
fishery of 1906, for instance, our estimate shows 18,500 fishermen;
but there were 40,000 persons engaged at the pearl camp alone, and
many others were given employment in boat-building, supplying provisions,
selling the pearls, etc., and this does not include the wives and
children depending on the industry for sustenance. Indeed, it seems
not unreasonable to estimate that instead of only the 18,500 fishermen,
85,000  persons were in a large measure dependent for their livelihood
on the Ceylon fishery in 1906.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estimated on the same basis, we have a total of 500,000 persons depending
largely on the pearl fisheries of the world for their support.
Thus we see that pearl buyers and pearl wearers not only gratify a
commendable admiration for the beautiful, but contribute largely to
the economic balance whereby one class of humanity either sustains or
is dependent upon another, even though these classes be so widely
separated as the crown of Russia from the half-starved diver of the
tropical seas. How strange is the providence of God, who, by granting
the pearl to the poor Arab, the Tamil of India, the South Sea
Islander, and the forgotten Selang of Mergui, makes the greatest and
wealthiest in the world contribute to their support.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>The pearl fisheries of the Persian Gulf are the most famous
and valuable in the world, and have been prosecuted for more
than two thousand years. A translation by that eminent
Assyriologist, Jules Oppert, of a cuneiform inscription on a
broken obelisk, erected presumably by a king of Nineveh, seems to indicate
a very early origin for these fisheries.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c017'><sup>[89]</sup></a> Professor Oppert’s
translation is:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>

      <div class='line'>In the sea where the North Star culminates,</div>
      <div class='line'>they fished for yellow amber.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The earliest writing of Europeans on the East refer to these fisheries.
An account of them was given by the Greek writer Megasthenes,
who accompanied Seleucus Nicator, the Macedonian general,
in his Asiatic conquests, about 307 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> Shortly afterward they were
noted by the Greek historian, Isidorus of Charace, in his account of
the Parthian Empire. Extracts from Nearchus preserved by Arrian
also mention them. Ptolemy speaks of the pearl fisheries which existed
from time immemorial at Tylos, the Roman name for the present
Island of Bahrein. These resources were well known in the days of
Pliny. In his “Historia Naturalis,” Book IX, ch. 35, he says: “But
the most perfect and exquisite [pearls] of all others be they that are
gotten about Arabia, within the Persian Gulf.”<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c017'><sup>[90]</sup></a> Pliny states also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>(Book VI, ch. 25) that Catifa (El Katiff), on the Arabian coast opposite
Bahrein, was the center of an important fishery.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the ninth century these fisheries were noted by Massoudi, one of
the earliest Arabian geographers.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c017'><sup>[91]</sup></a> In the latter part of the twelfth
century they were visited and described by the Spanish-Hebrew traveler,
Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c017'><sup>[92]</sup></a> The Arabian traveler, Ibn Batuta,
wrote of them about 1336.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c017'><sup>[93]</sup></a> In 1508 they were noted in the account
of Lodovico Barthema’s expedition to the Island of Ormus. According
to him:</p>

<p class='c020'>At three days’ journey from this island they fished the largest pearls
which are found in the world; and whoever wishes to know about it, behold!
There are certain fishermen who go there in small boats and cast into the
water two large stones attached to ropes, one at the bow, the other at the stern
of each boat to stay it in place. Then one of the fishermen hangs a sack from
his neck, attaches a large stone to his feet, and descends to the bottom—about
fifteen paces under water, where he remains as long as he can, searching for
oysters which bear pearls, and puts as many as he finds into his sack. When
he can remain no longer, he casts off the stone attached to his feet, and ascends
by one of the ropes fastened to the boat. There are so many connected with
the business that you will often see 300 of these little boats which come from
many countries.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c017'><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly following the visit of Barthema, the Portuguese under
Albuquerque took possession of the principal ports of the Persian
Gulf, and they imposed heavy taxes on the pearl fishery throughout
the century of their retention. While under their jurisdiction, the
fisheries were visited and described by J. H. van Linschoten in 1596,
who wrote:</p>

<p class='c020'>The principall and the best that are found in all the Orientall Countries, and
the right Orientall pearles, are between Ormus and Bassora in the straights, or
Sinus Persicus, in the places called Bareyn, Catiffa, Julfar, Camaron, and
other places in the said Sinus Persicus, from whence they are brought into
Ormus. The king of Portingale hath also his factor in Bareyn, that stayeth
there onlie for the fishing of pearles. There is great trafficke used with them,
as well in Ormus as in Goa.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c017'><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

was its wealth and commerce that it was a saying among the Portuguese, were the whole world a golden ring, Ormus would be the
jeweled signet. It was built on an island, supported a population of
40,000  persons, and was particularly well situated as a distributing
point for the pearls, which enriched the argosies of Portugal, and
contributed so largely to</p>

<p class='c018'>which Milton celebrates in “Paradise Lost.” This wonderful Ormus,
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries one of the wealthiest places
in the world, is now only a fishing village of less than a hundred
huts.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was at Ormus, nearly a century later, in 1670, that the shrewd
old jewel merchant, Tavernier, whose acquaintance with gems
doubtless equaled that of any man of his time, saw what he called
“the most beautiful pearl in the world”; not so much for its size, for
it weighed only 48¼ grains, nor for its regularity in form, but because
of its most wonderful luster.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c017'><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In describing the fisheries, which had been retaken by the Persians
in 1622, Tavernier wrote in 1670, according to Ball’s translation:</p>

<p class='c020'>There is a pearl fishery round the island of Bahren, in the Persian Gulf.
It belongs to the King of Persia, and there is a good fortress there, where a
garrison of 300 men is kept.... When the Portuguese held Hormuz
[Ormus] and Muscat, each boat which went to fish was obliged to take out a
license from them, which cost fifteen <i>abassis</i> [$5.45], and many brigantines
were maintained there, to sink those who were unwilling to take out licenses.
But since the Arabs have retaken Muscat, and the Portuguese are no longer
supreme in the Gulf, every man who fishes pays to the King of Persia only
five <i>abassis</i>, whether his fishing is successful or not. The merchant also pays
the king something small for every 1,000 oysters. The second pearl fishery is
opposite Bahren, on the coast of Arabia Felix, close to the town of El Katif,
which, with all the neighboring country, belongs to an Arab prince.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c017'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>During the century following Tavernier’s time, the fisheries were
vigorously prosecuted, owing to the impoverished condition of the
reefs in India and America, and to the large demand for pearls, not
only by the Oriental courts, but by the wealth and fashion of Europe.
Except for the last four years, when the Ceylon fishery was very productive,
throughout the eighteenth century the Persian Gulf was almost
the only important source of supply for pearls. For several years
following the reopening of the Ceylon fishery in 1796, that region
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>diverted some of the attention which the Persian waters had been receiving,
but it was not long before these regained their ascendancy.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1838, Lieutenant J. R. Wellsted, an officer in the British India
service, reported that the fisheries of the gulf employed 4300 boats,
manned by somewhat more than 30,000 men.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c017'><sup>[98]</sup></a> Of these boats, 3500
were from the Island of Bahrein, 100 from the Persian coast, and the
remaining 700 from the Pirate Coast situated between Bahrein and
the entrance to the Gulf of Oman. Lieutenant Wellsted estimated the
value of the pearls secured annually as approximately £400,000, which
is somewhat less than the average value of the output in recent years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Twenty-seven years later, according to Sir Lewis Pelly,<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c017'><sup>[99]</sup></a> who was
in the Indian service from 1851 to 1877, there were 1500 boats at
Bahrein, and the annual return from the whole fishery was £400,000,
the same as previously reported by Wellsted. In 1879, the value of the
output was estimated at £600,000 by the British Resident, Colonel
Ross, and at £800,000 by Captain L. E. Durand, of the British Protectorate
of the Persian Gulf. Owing to the increased market value, the
average output in the last five years has amounted to approximately
four million dollars annually. This refers to the local value only,
which is greatly increased by the time the pearls leave the markets in
Bombay and Bagdad.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Persian Gulf is nearly 600 miles long, with an average width of
somewhat more than 100 miles. The Strait of Ormus—thirty to
sixty miles wide—connects it with the Gulf of Oman, which opens
directly into the Arabian Sea. The depth of water rarely exceeds
thirty fathoms. Oyster reefs are well distributed throughout the
gulf, and are in greatest abundance on the Arab side between the 24th
and 27th degrees of north latitude and the 50th and 54th degrees of
east longitude, at a distance of from a few hundred yards to sixty
miles from the shore, and especially in the vicinity of the Bahrein
Islands. The oysters are scattered over level areas of coral rock and
sand, with depths ranging from two to eighteen fathoms.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c017'><sup>[100]</sup></a> The divers
rarely descend in deeper water than twelve fathoms, notwithstanding
that valuable pearls are apparently obtainable at greater depths.</p>

<p class='c013'>Although the British Protectorate extends over the Persian Gulf,
insuring the peaceful prosecution of the fisheries and the settlement
of intertribal contentions by the government resident, the fisheries are
under the regulations of the maritime Arab sheiks. The restrictions
imposed by these, however, are principally with a view to collecting a
revenue from each boat employed. The total amount realized thereby
is unknown, but there is good reason for supposing that it is considerable.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>The fisheries are carried on during the greater part of every year,
presenting a strong contrast to the Ceylon fishery, which is prosecuted
usually less than forty days, and in only about one year in three on an
average. This is especially remarkable when it is considered that no
particular care is taken of the Persian reefs and, except for certain
tribal restrictions, the fishermen may work whenever and wherever
they choose. Owing to the extended area over which the fishing is
prosecuted and the existence of undisturbed breeding-oysters in the
deeper waters, the reefs are not readily exhausted, notwithstanding
the tens of millions of mollusks annually removed therefrom.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fisheries are at their height from June to September, when nearly
every person on the coast is interested in some capacity, if not in fishing,
at least in furnishing supplies, cleaning shells, buying pearls, etc.
In April and May the water on the deep banks is so cold that the fishermen
confine their efforts to the more shallow areas. During the winter
months, the cold weather and the northwesterly gales interfere with
the work, except such as is prosecuted in the smaller bays and
inlets.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearling operations are financed mostly by Indian <i>bunnias</i>, or
traders, principally from Bombay, who furnish capital for equipment,
supplies of food, etc., and who purchase the pearls in gross lots. These
men bear very hard on the fishermen, furnishing the supplies and buying
the pearls almost at their own prices; and the poor divers who explore
the depths and secure the pearls derive from their exertions
little more than the crudest necessaries of life, and are usually in debt
to the traders.</p>

<p class='c013'>The actual fishing operations are carried on mainly by the maritime
tribes of Hasa and Oman, including those on the Pirate Coast. The
inhabitants of the Bahrein Islands and the adjacent shores have been
devoted to pearling from time immemorial; but the Wahabis of the
Pirate Coast—the <i>Ichthyophagi</i> of Ptolemy’s time—have more recently,
under the persuasive influence of British gunboats and magazine-rifles,
substituted pearling for their two-century inherited life
of fanatical piracy. Referring to these people in his quaint sketches
of Persia eighty years ago, Sir John Malcolm wrote: “Their occupation
is piracy, and their delight murder, and to make it worse they give
you the most pious reasons for every villainy they commit. They
abide by the letter of the sacred volume, rejecting all commentaries and
traditions. If you are their captive and offer all to save your life, they
say, “No! It is written in the Koran that it is not lawful to plunder
the living; but we are not prohibited from stripping the dead. So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>saying they knock you on the head.”<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c017'><sup>[101]</sup></a> Most of the Wahabi pearlers
congregate in the mat-hut settlements of Dobai, Abu Thubi, and Ras-el-Kheima,
located at the mouths of creeks which form fairly good
harbors for the small boats. The Batina coast also furnishes some
pearl fishermen, these coming principally from Fujaira, Shenas, Sohar,
Suaik, and Sib.</p>

<p class='c013'>The headquarters for the pearling fleet are at Bahrein Island, the
largest of the insular group bearing the same name, the islets of
Moharrek, Sitrah, and Nissan completing the group. This is the early
home of Chaldean civilization, and one of the traditional sources of
the Phenicians, and whence came that fish-god who—according to the
Babylonian myth—bore the ark over the deluge. This island, the center
of the greatest pearl fishery in the world, is half way down on the
southern side of the Persian Gulf, and twenty miles from the mainland
of “Araby the blest.” It is about twenty-eight miles in length,
and ten in width at the widest part. The population approximates
60,000, all Moslems, except about 100 Banyan traders from Sindh,
India. The northern half of the island is described as of great beauty,
being a garden of pomegranate, lemon, citron, and quince-trees, and
especially the magnificent date-palms, with numerous springs furnishing
an abundance of excellent fresh water. The principal settlement,
Manama, with about 10,000 inhabitants, is poorly built,
the houses consisting mostly of huts of mats and palm leaves; yet it
presents a better appearance than any other settlement along this
coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>The one great industry, and the center of all interest throughout
this region, is the pearl fishery. The present conditions are precisely
as Palgrave wrote in 1863: “It is from the sea, not from the land, that
the natives subsist; and it is also mainly on the sea that they dwell,
passing amid its waters the one half of the year in search of pearls,
the other half in fishery or trade. Hence their real homes are the
countless boats which stud the placid pool, or stand drawn up in long
black lines on the shore, while little care is taken to ornament their
land houses, the abodes of their wives and children at most, and the
unsightly strong boxes of their treasures. ‘We are all, from the highest
to the lowest, slaves of one master—Pearl,’ said Mohammed bin
Thanee to me one evening; nor was the expression out of place. All
thought, all conversation, all employment, turns on that one subject;
everything else is merely by-game, and below even secondary consideration.”<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c017'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<p>ARAB PEARL-DIVERS AT WORK IN THE PERSIAN GULF</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>According to recent returns, the Persian Gulf fisheries employ about
3500 boats,<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c017'><sup>[103]</sup></a> large and small, of which 1200 of the best are owned
at Bahrein, 700 on the coast of El Hassa from El Katar to Kuweit,
and the remaining 1600 are from various parts of the gulf, and especially
from the Pirate Coast east of El Katar. They measure from one
to fifty tons. The smaller ones, with three to fifteen men each, work
near the shores; the larger, carrying fifteen to thirty men, fish over
the whole gulf, remaining out for weeks at a time. These craft are
very picturesque with their artistic rigs and spoon-shaped sails, and
when the fishery is at its height the scene is one of rare interest. The
boats from Bahrein are of excellent construction made by native workmen
using local materials, with home-woven sailcloth and rigging of
twisted date-fiber. Each of the larger ones usually evidences a lingering
trace of Semitic influence in its <i>kubait</i>, or figurehead, covered with
skin of the sheep or goat sacrificed in the launching ceremonies.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c017'><sup>[104]</sup></a> The
boats from El Hassa and the Pirate Coast are usually smaller and less
substantial than those from Bahrein, the fishermen from the latter
place far surpassing those of the mainland in civilization and industrial
wealth.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fleet is manned by approximately 35,000 fishermen. In addition
to the <i>nakhoda</i>, or captain, who is often the owner of the boat, the
crew consists of <i>ghoas</i> or divers, who are mainly Arabs and Sedees,
and <i>sebs</i>, or rope-tenders, who are usually Bedouins or Persians and
attend the divers and perform other duties. Many Hindus from India,
and flat-nosed, sable-hued Negroes from the east coast of Africa find
employment here. On each of the larger boats is a general utility
man, known as <i>el musully</i>, literally the “prayer-man,” who, in addition
to various other duties, relieves those <i>sebs</i> who stop to pray.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the fishermen are all types and classes to be met with in this
part of the world, with the usual contingent of the lame, the halt, and
the blind. There are a number of fishermen who have been maimed
and mutilated by shark bites. A surprisingly large number of men
who have become totally blind engage in diving, and they usually do
fairly well where the oysters are abundant on the reefs. And one or
two unfortunate divers are reported who continue the work even
though handicapped by the loss both of a leg and of eyesight, this
interfering less with their diving than with their movements on land.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fishery in this region owes absolutely nothing to modern civilization
in the method of securing the pearls from the depth of the sea;
it is carried on to-day practically as it was six hundred years ago, and
probably has been without important variation for two thousand years.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Aside from a loin-cloth, the diver is devoid of clothing except that
rarely, early in the season when <i>polypi</i> abound, he is enveloped in a
cotton overall as a protection. Over each finger and thumb he wears a
shield or stall (<i>khubaat</i>, or finger-hat), about two inches long, made of
flexible leather, to protect the fingers from the sharp shells and coral-growths.
As each fisherman usually wears out at least two sets of
these shields each season, it will be seen that a very large quantity of
them is required to supply the entire fleet.</p>

<p class='c013'>The divers use stones on which they descend feet foremost. Although
this is less spectacular than the method of diving practised by
the natives of the South Sea islands, it enables the fisherman to reach
the bottom more speedily and with far less effort. The diving-stones
range in weight from thirty to fifty pounds each, depending largely on
the depth of water and the weight of the fisherman. They are somewhat
oval in shape, and have one end perforated to admit a rope. Immediately
above the attachment is formed a loop, resembling a stirrup,
to receive the diver’s foot. When prepared for the day’s work, each
stone is suspended by a stout rope over outriggers projecting from
the side of the boat, and by a slip-knot is temporarily held four and
a half or five feet below the surface of the water. A very stout diver
may have a stone affixed to his waist to overcome his greater buoyancy.
Usually two divers use one stone together and descend alternately.
Each one has an attendant in the boat who assists him in
ascending, and looks after the ropes, baskets of shells, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>In preparing for descent, the fisherman takes hold of the rope from
which the diving stone is suspended, puts one foot in the loop just
above the stone and places the other foot in the rim of a net basket,
eighteen inches wide, made of coir rope. When ready, he signals his
attendant, inhales several good breaths, closes his nostrils with a
<i>fitaam</i> or nostril-clasp of flexible horn attached to a cord around his
neck, raises his body somewhat above the surface to give force to the
descent, releases the slip-knot retaining the stone, and sinks rapidly
to the bottom. Immediately disengaging his foot from the stone, he
throws himself in a stooping position on the ground and collects as
many oysters as possible during the fifty seconds or more in which he
is able to remain under water. When near his limit of endurance, he
hastily gives a signal jerk to the rope attached to the basket, and the
watchful attendant hauls him up as speedily as possible, the diver
frequently quickening the ascent by hand over hand movement up the
rope. When near the surface, he lets go of the rope and with his arms
close to his body pops above the surface puffing and blowing. The
contents of the net bag are emptied into a large basket by the attendant,
and the dead shells and other refuse are separated from the live
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>oysters and thrown back into the sea, the diver having worked too
rapidly at the bottom to discriminate closely as to what he gathered.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the meantime, the stone has been drawn up and suspended by the
slip-knot in its customary position and the diving partner is resting at
the surface preparatory to descending. Thus, diving alternately at
intervals of five or six minutes, each fisherman descends thirty or forty
times in an ordinary day’s work. The number of oysters gathered at
each descent depends on such conditions as their abundance, the depth
and clearness of the water, etc. It ranges from none to fifty or more,
but ordinarily ten or twelve is a good average. As the men commonly
work on shares, the shells brought up by each diver or by each pair of
divers are kept separate.</p>

<p class='c013'>The best type of Arab divers are very careful of themselves, drying
the body thoroughly with towels on coming out of the water, taking
intervals of rest during the day’s work; and even while in the water
between dives they may enjoy the luxury of a cheroot or pipe, or possibly
a cigarette may pass from mouth to mouth of several men.</p>

<p class='c013'>When pursuing their work, the divers are abstemious. After devotions
at sunrise and a light breakfast of perhaps dates or rice and
coffee, they begin fishing. About noon they knock off for coffee,
prayers, and an hour’s siesta, and then resume work for several hours.
When the day’s work is over and they have faced Meccaward with the
customary prayers, they rest and eat a substantial meal, commonly of
dates and fish roasted over a charcoal fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>In equal depths the Arab fishermen remain under water longer
than those of India who resort to the Ceylon fishery, but this is partly
counterbalanced by the latter descending somewhat more frequently.
When preparing for a lengthy dive, the fisherman imbibes large quantities
of air, opening his mouth and inhaling large volumes.</p>

<p class='c013'>The length of time a diver remains submerged in the average depth
of seven or eight fathoms rarely exceeds sixty seconds, although some
may remain seventy, eighty, and even ninety seconds on special occasion.
A fully substantiated instance is reported from Manaar of an
Arab diver having remained 109 seconds in seven fathoms of water.
This occurred April 13, 1887, and was witnessed and reported<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c017'><sup>[105]</sup></a> by Captain
James Donnan, the inspector of the fishery. Wellsted reports<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c017'><sup>[106]</sup></a> a
diving contest in the Persian Gulf in which only one man, of the
hundreds who competed, remained down 110 seconds; the depth, however,
is not noted.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are numerous reports of much longer stays than these; indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>a study of the published evidence bearing upon the subject furnishes
surprising results. Ribeiro wrote, in 1685, that a diver could
remain below while two <i>credos</i> were repeated: “<i>Il s’y tient l’espace de
deux credo.</i>”<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c017'><sup>[107]</sup></a> In his interesting account of the Ceylon fishery, Percival
stated that the usual length of time for divers to remain under
water “does not much exceed two minutes, yet there are instances
known of divers who could remain four or even five minutes, which
was the case with a Caffre boy the last year I visited the fishery. The
longest instance ever known was of a diver who came from Anjango
in 1797, and who absolutely remained under water full six minutes.”<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c017'><sup>[108]</sup></a>
Le Beck says, that in 1797, he saw a diver from Karikal
remain down for the space of seven minutes.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c017'><sup>[109]</sup></a> The merchant
traveler, Jean Chardin, reported in 1711 that the divers remain
up to seven and a half minutes under water: “<i>Les plongeurs qui
pêchent les perles sont quelquefois jusqu’à demi-quart-d’heure sous
l’eau.</i>”<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c017'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In 1667, the Royal Society of London addressed an inquiry on this
subject to Sir Philiberto Vernatti, the British Resident at Batavia in
the East Indies. Vernatti’s reply gave certain details regarding the
Ceylon fishery, but did not touch upon the length of diving because,
as he stated, he could not “meet with any one that can satisfy me, and
being unsatisfied myself, I cannot nor will obtrude anything upon you
which may hereafter prove fabulous; but shall still serve you with
truth.”<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c017'><sup>[111]</sup></a> Two years later, and presumably after investigation, Vernatti
reported: “The greatest length of time that pearl-divers in these
parts can continue under water is about a quarter of an hour; and that
by no other means than custom; for pearl-diving lasts not above six
weeks, and the divers stay a great while longer at the end of the
season than at the beginning.”<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c017'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>The anatomist Diemerbroeck relates<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c017'><sup>[113]</sup></a> the case of a pearl diver who,
under his own observation, remained half an hour at a time under
water while pursuing his work; and this was seriously adopted without
comment by John Mason Goode in his “Study of Medicine.”<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c017'><sup>[114]</sup></a> Ibn
Batuta, “the Doctor of Tangier,” wrote about 1336 that “some remain
down an hour, others two hours, others less.”<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c017'><sup>[115]</sup></a> A still earlier writer,
Jouchanan ibn Masouiah,<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c017'><sup>[116]</sup></a> in his book on stones, states that “the diver,
when he dives, places upon his nose a <i>masfâsa</i> lest water should enter
into him, and breathes through the fissure, and remains under water
for half an hour.” According to Sebaldus Rau<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c017'><sup>[117]</sup></a> this <i>masfâsa</i> was an
article resembling a hood or cap, which the diver placed over his nose.
It was made of some impervious material and had a projection so long
that it reached to the surface of the water. The same writer believes
that this object was alluded to by Aristotle (“De part. animal.,” <i>Lib.</i>
II, c. 16), where he likens the trunk of the elephant to the instrument
used by certain divers for aiding their respiration, so that they could
remain longer in the water and draw in air from above the surface.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c017'><sup>[118]</sup></a>
And here we cease pursuit of further records, lest our faith in recorded
testimony be too severely tested.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c017'><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A superficial inspection of the above evidence, from the one or two
hours noted by Ibn Batuta about the year 1336, to the half an hour of
Diemerbroeck in 1672, the quarter of an hour of Vernatti in 1669, the
seven and one half minutes of Chardin in 1711, the six minutes of
Percival in 1803, to the 110 seconds of the present time, seems to indicate
very clearly a gradual but somewhat remarkable decrease in
the ability of the Asiatic divers, and that the pearl fishermen of the
present day are very different creatures from their ancestors. And
especially is this so when it is considered that the above records are
not isolated reports selected for the particular purpose of showing
a decrease in the length of diving; on the contrary they are
authoritative and representative publications of their respective
periods. We do not recall having seen in any report issued previous
to 1675, an intimation that the limit of time was less than ten
minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>However, a careful consideration of the subject leads to the belief
that there has been no serious decrease in the length of time that the
Arab and Indian divers remain under water, and that either the
writers were misinformed or that the individual cases reported were
extremely exceptional. Ibn Batuta’s instance of one to two hours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>could easily be caused by a mistake in copying Arabic manuscript, or
in the translation. The case related by Diemerbroeck in which a pearl
diver remained submerged half an hour, is more perplexing, especially
as the physician reports that this was done under his own observation.
The numerous reports of five or six minutes may have been based on a
very exceptional case.</p>

<p class='c013'>These statements are viewed as highly incredible by men who have
spent scores of years at the fisheries. A man may remain submerged
for several minutes, but the conditions are vastly different from the
activities of pearl-gathering at a depth of ten fathoms, where the
pressure of the water is nearly thirty pounds to the square inch, and
the slightest exercise is fatiguing. Unless the time is taken by a
watch, it is easy to overestimate the stay; the seconds pass very slowly
when one is waiting momentarily for the appearance of the diver’s
head above the water, and certainly to the nearly exhausted fisherman
with straining chest and palpitating heart, the last few seconds must
seem extremely long indeed. An instance is noted in which an Arab
diver remained submerged seventy-one seconds, and on his reappearance,
naïvely inquired if he had not been down ten minutes. It seems
doubtful whether the 110 seconds herein noted has been greatly exceeded,
in recent years at least, by Arab or Indian divers, who do not
appear to equal the semi-amphibious natives of the South Sea islands
in their exploits.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the most curious features of the pearling industry is the
manner in which the fishermen secure supplies of drinking water. In
the vicinity of Bahrein, numerous fresh-water springs exist at the
bottom of the gulf in depths of two or three fathoms, and the fishermen
dive into the depth of the salt water down to where the fresh
water is springing forth and there fill a skin or other suitable receptacle
which they bring to the surface. By running a pipe down near
the bottom in the vicinity of one of these springs, an abundance of
fresh water may be pumped into the boat.</p>

<p class='c013'>Three species—or at least three varieties—of pearl-bearing oysters
are obtained in the Persian Gulf. These are known locally as <i>mahar</i>,
<i>sudaifee</i>, and <i>zinni</i>. Of these, the <i>mahar</i> or Lingah oyster, which
corresponds to the Ceylon pearl-oyster, yields the greatest quantity of
pearls, and those of the finest quality. It measures three or three and
a half inches in diameter, and is found in deeper water than the others.
The <i>sudaifee</i> and the <i>zinni</i>, which are larger, yield pearls in much
smaller quantities than the <i>mahar</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>On large boats, which remain out for two or three weeks at a time,
the oysters are left on deck overnight, and the following morning they
are opened by means of a curved knife (<i>miflaket</i>), four or five inches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>in length. The smaller boats working near shore convey the catch to
the land for the opening and searching for pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Persian Gulf pearls are commonly not so white as those from
Ceylon, but they are found of larger size, and it is believed in Asia
that they retain their luster for a greater length of time. Many of
the Persian Gulf pearls, especially those from <i>sudaifee</i> and <i>zinni</i>
shells, have a distinctly yellow color. Tavernier made a curious explanation
of this. He stated:</p>

<p class='c020'>As for the pearls tending to yellow, the color is due to the fact that the
fishermen sell the oysters in heaps, and the merchants awaiting sometimes up
to 14 or 15 days till the shells open of themselves, in order to extract the
pearls, some of these oysters lose their water during this time, decay, and
become putrid, and the pearls become yellow by contact. This is so true that
in all oysters which have retained their water, the pearls are always white.
They are allowed to open of themselves, because if they are opened by force,
as we open our oysters in the shell, the pearls may be damaged and broken.
The oysters of the Manar Strait open of themselves, 5 or 6 days sooner than
those of the Gulf of Persia, because the heat is much greater at Manar, which
is at the tenth degree of North latitude, while the island of Bahrein is at about
the twenty-seventh. And consequently among the pearls which come from
Manar there are few yellow ones found.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c017'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Tavernier was more familiar with the pearls themselves than with
the methods of the fishery. The yellow color is not due to contact
with the putrefactive flesh, and is independent of the manner of opening.
In fact, if putrefaction caused the yellow color, this shade
would be far more prevalent in the Manaar or Ceylon pearls than in
those from Bahrein, for practically all of the Ceylon oysters are permitted
to putrefy, whereas only a portion of those in the Persian Gulf
are opened in this manner. Furthermore, notwithstanding that it is
nearer the equator, the heat at Manaar during the pearling season is not
to be compared with that at Bahrein when the season is at its height,
for the Persian Gulf during July and August is notorious as one of
the hottest places on the globe.</p>

<p class='c013'>While the great bulk of the pearls are either white or yellowish,
these fisheries yield a few pink, bluish, gray, and occasionally even
black pearls. These unusual colors are not especially prized. A curious
and remarkably detailed story has gone the rounds in which the
qualities of Persian and Ceylon pearls are compared, to the disparagement
of the latter, and during the last hundred years few accounts
have been published of this fishery without recording it. We notice
it first in Morier’s “Journey through Persia in 1808 and 1809,”<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c017'><sup>[121]</sup></a> but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>possibly it antedated that report. The statement is that the pearls of
Ceylon peel off, while those of Persia are as “firm as the rock on which
they grow”; and though they lose in color and luster one per cent. annually
for fifty years, they still lose less than those of Ceylon, and at
the expiration of the fifty years they cease to diminish in appearance.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearl output in the Persian Gulf at the present time appears
from the official returns to exceed four million dollars annually at local
valuation. The exports in 1903 were reported at £827,447, and in
1904, £1,077,241. It is generally understood that all of the pearls are
not entered in the official figures, and the valuations in the markets of
Asia and Europe are greatly in excess of these amounts. The profits
of the fishery are divided among a great number of persons. A large
percentage goes to the shrewd <i>bunnias</i> from India, who finance the
fishery operations, and who, by all sorts of tricks connected with advances
of supplies, valuation of the catch, etc., manage to make a very
good thing out of the business. It is nothing unusual for the valuation
of a lot of pearls to double and even treble after leaving the hands
of the fishermen.</p>

<p class='c013'>While many of the gulf pearls—and especially of the small seed-pearls—go
to Bagdad, the great bulk of them are sold to representatives
of Hindu and Arab merchants of Bombay for shipment to that
city, which to the Bahrein fisherman is the heart of the outside world.
Few of the pearls go directly into Arabia or Persia, as the certain sale
in the larger Bombay market is preferable to a sometimes higher but
less regular price in other markets. Indeed, pearls may usually be
purchased at a less cost in India than a stranger would be obliged to
pay at Bahrein. The Bombay merchants “sow the earth with Orient
pearl,” dealing direct with London, Paris and Berlin, and with the
oriental jewelers. Most of the yellow pearls find oriental purchasers,
with whose dark complexions they harmonize better than the silvery
white ones. They are also more popular because of a belief existing
throughout the East that they are less likely to lose their luster with
the lapse of years.</p>

<p class='c013'>The shell of the pearl-oysters is not used locally, but large quantities
are exported to Europe for manufacture. Although it is the smallest
and cheapest produced in the gulf, yet, owing to the enormous quantity
taken for their pearls, the shell of the <i>mahar</i> (<i>Margaritifera vulgaris</i>)
constitutes the bulk of the exports. Formerly most of the
shipments were made from the harbor of Lingah, hence it is known in
the markets of Europe as “Lingah shell.” But in the last three or four
years, much of it has been transported to Europe via Bander Abbas
and Bushire. A German firm at Bahrein is extensively employed in
exporting this shell, and several Indian merchants are also engaged in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>the trade. The total exports in 1906 amounted to 3262 tons, valued at
$26,408 according to the port returns, but worth about $135,000 in
Europe. Very large quantities are received in London, and over
2500 tons have been offered at auction in a single year. This shell is
very small, averaging about three inches in diameter and about one
and a half ounces in weight. It is the cheapest of all mother-of-pearl.
The best quality sells in London for ten to twenty shillings per hundredweight,
but the ordinary grade is worth usually less than nine
shillings, and sometimes as low as three shillings per hundredweight.
America formerly imported it, but few lots have been received since
the exploitation of the Mississippi shell about fifteen years ago.</p>

<p class='c013'>The shell of the larger species of pearl-oysters in the Persian Gulf
is worth considerably more than the “Lingah shell,” selling in Europe
for £12 to £60 per ton, yet manufacturers consider it as furnishing
only poor qualities of mother-of-pearl. Several hundred tons are exported
annually. It measures six or seven inches in diameter and is
used principally in making cheap grades of buttons.</p>

<p class='c013'>Second in extent to those of Persia only, are the intermittent and uncertain
pearl fisheries of the Gulf of Manaar. This is an arm of the
Indian Ocean, from 65 to 150 miles in width, separating the island of
Ceylon from the southernmost part of India. The pearl-oyster banks—known
locally as paars—are situated off the northwest coast of
Ceylon and also in the vicinity of Tuticorin on the Madras coast of the
mainland. The Ceylon fisheries are under the control of the colonial
government of the British Empire, and those of the mainland are
monopolized by the Madras government. Notwithstanding the fact
that they are outside of the three-mile limit established as the bound
of national jurisdiction, exclusive privileges are exercised over these
fisheries by the respective governments,<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c017'><sup>[122]</sup></a> and poaching vessels are
liable to seizure and punishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Though possibly not so ancient as those of Persia, the Ceylon pearl
fisheries are of great antiquity. References to them occur in Cingalese
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>records dating from 550 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> Pliny, Ptolemy, Strabo, and other ancient
writers speak of their importance.</p>

<p class='c013'>The “Periplus of the Erythræan”—written about the end of the
second century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>—refers to these fisheries, and states that, owing
to the dangers involved, it was customary to employ convicts therein.
In the days of the “Arabian Nights,” under the name “Serendib,” this
was the scene of the pearling adventures of Sindbad the Sailor, and
the reputation of the valuable pearl resources is reflected in those
wonderful tales.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first extensive description we have of the Gulf of Manaar fisheries
was given by the Venetian traveler, Marco Polo, who visited the
region about 1294. He wrote:</p>

<p class='c020'>The pearl fishers take their vessels, great and small, and proceed into the
gulf where they stop from the beginning of April till the middle of May.
They go first to a place called Bettelar, and then go 60 miles into the Gulf.
Here they cast anchor and shift from their large vessels into small boats.
You must know that the many merchants who go divide into various companies,
and each of these must engage a number of men on wages, hiring them
for April and half of May. Of all the produce they have first to pay the king,
as his royalty, the tenth part. And they must also pay those men who charm
the great fishes to prevent them from injuring the divers whilst engaged in
seeking pearls under water, one-twentieth of all that they take. These fish-charmers
are termined <i>Abraiaman</i>; and their charm holds good for that day
only, for at night they dissolve the charm so that the fishes can work mischief
at their will. These <i>Abraiaman</i> know also how to charm beasts and birds and
every living thing. When the men have got into the small boats they jump
into the water and dive to the bottom, which may be at a depth of from 4 to
12 fathoms, and there they remain as long as they are able. And there they
find the shells that contain the pearls, and those they put into a net bag tied
round the waist, and mount up to the surface with them, and then dive anew.
When they can’t hold their breath any longer they come up again, and after
a little down they go once more, and so they go on all day. These shells are
in fashion like oysters or sea-hoods. And in these shells are found pearls,
great and small, of every kind, sticking in the flesh of the shell-fish. In this
manner pearls are fished in great quantities, for thence in fact come the
pearls which are spread all over the world. And I can tell you the King of
that State hath a very great receipt and treasure from his dues upon those
pearls.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c017'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>That quaint old missionary bishop, Friar Jordanus, in his “Mirabilia
Descripta, or the Wonders of the East” (<i>circa</i> 1330), reports that
“more than 8000 boats” were sometimes employed for three months
continually in these fisheries, which were then prosecuted under the
jurisdiction of the Cingalese kings of Kandy, and that the quantity of
pearls taken was “astounding and almost incredible.”<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c017'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>This number of boats seems entirely too large, especially in view of
the fact that Jordanus secured his information at second hand; but it
leaves the impression that the fisheries of that period were of great
importance.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Portuguese, attracted by the wealth of its resources, obtained
control of this region about 1510, they exacted from the local
rulers an annual tribute in pearls and spices. Later they conducted
the fisheries on their own account, permitting the native fishermen to
retain one fourth of the catch as compensation for their work, and
dividing the remainder into three equal portions, for the king, the
church, and the soldiers, respectively.</p>

<p class='c013'>Linschoten, who visited India about 1590, leaves this interesting
account of the fishery at that time:</p>

<p class='c020'>“There are also other fishings for pearle, as between the Iland of Seylon,
and the Cape de Comoriin, where great numbers are yearlie found, for that the
King of Portingale hath a captaine there with soldiers that looketh unto it;
they have yearlie at the least above 3 or 4 thousand duckers [divers], yt
live onlie by fishing for pearles, and so maintaine themselves.” He describes
the methods of fishing, which appear to be similar to those of the present time,
and adds: “When they have made an end of the day’s fishing, all the fishers
with the captaine, soldiers, laborers and watchmen for the king, goe together,
and taking all the pearls [pearl-oysters] that are caught that day they divide
them into certaine heaps, that is, one part for the king, another part for the
captaine and soldiers, the third part for the Jesuits, because they have their
Cloyster in that place, and brought the countrie first into the Christian faith,
and the last part for the Fishers, which is done with Justice and Equalitie.
This fishing is done in the Summer tyme, and there passeth not any yeare but
that divers Fishers are drowned by the Cape de Comoriin (which is called the
King’s fishing) and manie devoured by fishes, so that when the fishing is done
there is great and pitiful noyse and cry of women and children heard. Yet the
next yeare they must do the same work againe, for that they have no other
means to live, as also for that they are partlie compelled thereunto by the
Portingales, but most part because of the gaine.”<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c017'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The best description we have seen of the Ceylon fisheries at the time
of the Portuguese occupation, is that of Caesar Frederick, a Venetian
trader, who referred to the period from 1563 to 1581. Frederick reported,
according to Hickocke’s translation in the Hakluyt edition:</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>The sea that lieth between the coast which descendeth from Cao Comori,
to the lowe land of Chilao, and from Island Zeilan, they call the fishing of
Pearles, which fishing they make every yeare, beginning in March or April,
and it lasteth fiftie dayes, but they doe not fishe every yeere in one place, but
one yeere in one place, and another yeere in another place of the same sea.
When the time of this fishing draweth neere, they send very good Divers, that
goe to discover where the greatest heapes of Oisters bee under water, and
right agaynst that place where greatest store of Oisters bee, there they make
or plant a village with houses and a Bazaro, which standeth as long as the
fishing time lasteth, and it is furnished with all things necessarie, and nowe
and then it is neere unto places that are inhabited, and other times farre off,
according to the place where they fishe. The fishermen are all Christians of
the countrey, and who so will may goe to fishing, paying a certain dutie to the
king of Portugall, and to the Churches of the Friers of Saint Paule, which
are in that coast. All the while that they are fishing, there are three or foure
Fustes armed to defend the Fishermen from Rovers. It was my chance to
bee there one time in my passage, and I saw the order that they used in
fishing, which is this. There are three or foure Barkes that make consort
together, which are like to our litle Pilot boates, and a little lesse, there goe
seven or eight men in a boate: and I have seene in a morning a great number
of them goe out, and anker in fifteene or eighteene fadome of water, which is
the ordinarie depth of all that coast. When they are at anker, they cast a rope
into the sea, and at the end of the rope, they make fast a great stone, and then
there is readie a man that hath his nose and his eares well stopped, and annointed
with oyle, and a basket about his necke, or under his left arme, then he
goeth downe by the rope to the bottome of the Sea, and as fast as he can hee
filleth the basket, and when it is full, he shaketh the rope, and his fellows that
are in the Barke hale him up with the basket: and in such wise they go one by
one untill they have laden their barke with oysters, and at evening they come
to the village, and then every company maketh their mountaine or heape of
oysters one distant from another, in such wise that you shall see a great long
rowe of mountaines or heapes of oysters, and they are not touched until such
time as the fishing bee ended, and at the ende of the fishing every companie
sitteth round about their mountaine or heape of oysters, and fall to opening of
them, which they may easilie doe because they bee dead, drie and brittle: and
if every oyster had pearles in them, it would be a very good purchase, but
there are very many that have no pearles in them: when the fishing is ended,
then they see whether it bee a good gathering or a badde: there are certaine
expert in the pearles whom they call Chitini, which set and make the price of
pearles according to their carracts [carats or weight], beautie, and goodnesse,
making foure sorts of them. The first sort bee the round pearles, and they
bee called Aia of Portugale, because the Portugales doe buy them. The second
sorte which are not round, are called Aia of Bengala. The third sort which
are not so good as the second, they call Aia of Canara, that is to say, the
kingdome of Bezeneger. The fourth and last sort, which are the least and
worst sort, are called Aia of Cambaia. Thus the price being set, there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>merchants of every countrey which are readie with their money in their handes,
so that in a fewe dayes all is brought up at the prises set according to the
goodnesse and caracts of the pearles.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c017'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A remarkable instance of the immutability of custom in the Orient
is found in the fact that, except in a few minor particulars, Frederick’s
account, written more than three centuries ago, could serve as a
description of the methods of the fisheries in recent years. The industry
was then very extensive, as appears from an account shortly
afterward (about 1608) by Pedro Teixeira, who reported<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c017'><sup>[127]</sup></a> that from
400 to 500 boats were employed, and from 50,000 to 60,000 persons
resorted to the fishery.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1658, possession of Ceylon and India passed from the Portuguese
to the Dutch, who for a time continued the pearl fisheries after
the manner practised by their predecessors; but owing to contentions
as to the details of management, they soon resorted to leasing them
each year to the highest bidder, or to several bidders, for a definite
money payment. The successful bidders prosecuted the industry in
the same manner as the government had previously done, employing
the same native fishermen and compensating them with one fourth of
the oysters secured. Under the Dutch rule the fisheries were very unprofitable,
and particularly so during the last seventy years of their
authority. There was practically no fishing from 1732 to 1746, and
there was also a suspension—but not entirely from lack of oysters or
of pearls—from 1768 until the territory passed into the control of
the British in 1796.</p>

<p class='c013'>The colonial government of the British Empire continued the Dutch
policy of leasing, only restricting the limits of territory and season for
fishing. Many objections were found to this method. It was difficult
to regulate the business properly, and there were no reliable means of
determining its proceeds and conditions. At length in 1835, the government
began to operate the fishery on its own account, as the Portuguese
had done two hundred years before, allowing the fishermen one
fourth of the oysters taken by them and selling the remaining three
fourths for the benefit of the treasury. In this way the full value of
the resources was realized without mystery, deception, or concealment,
and the plan worked satisfactorily for all concerned.</p>

<p class='c013'>Owing, presumably, to the long period in which they had lain undisturbed,
the Ceylon oyster reefs were in excellent condition at the
beginning of British rule. In 1796 the government derived a revenue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>of Rs.1,100,000 therefrom, and in 1797 the revenue was Rs.1,400,000;
these two years were by far the most productive during the first century
of British occupation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Several very interesting reports on the industry were prepared
about that time. Especially to be noted among these were the accounts
by Henry J. LeBeck in 1798;<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c017'><sup>[128]</sup></a> by Robert Percival in 1803;<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c017'><sup>[129]</sup></a>
and by James Cordiner in 1807,<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c017'><sup>[130]</sup></a> to which reference is made for detailed
accounts of the fisheries of that period.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Ceylon fishery was prosecuted about every other year from
1799 to 1809, and the annual returns ranged from £15,022 in 1801 to
£84,257 in 1808. From 1810 to 1813, inclusive, there was a blank so
far as receipts were concerned. In 1814 the fishery was very good,
bringing in a revenue of £105,187. With the exception of very slight
returns in 1815, 1816, and 1820, no oysters were then obtained until
1828. Excepting 1832 and 1834, the industry was prosecuted each
year from 1828 to 1837, the revenue to the government averaging
about £30,000 annually. Then came a long blank of seventeen years,
for there was no fishing from 1838 to 1854, and likewise from 1864 to
1873. Indeed, so depleted had the beds throughout the Gulf of Manaar
become in 1866, that serious consideration was given to the possibilities
of securing seed oysters from the Persian Gulf for restocking the
reefs; but fortunately this was rendered unnecessary by the discovery
soon afterward of a few oysters on several reefs on both the Ceylon
and the Malabar coasts.</p>

<p class='c013'>From 1855 to 1863, and also from 1874 to 1881, the returns were
only ordinary, the highest being £51,017 in 1863, and £59,868 in 1881,—the
best year since 1814; and during these two periods fishing was
entirely omitted in nearly one half the seasons. There were five lean
years from 1882 to 1886, and the 1887 fishery was only fair, with a
yield of £39,609. But the returns for 1888 were large, amounting to
£80,424; and those for 1891 were even greater, being £96,370, representing
a yield of 44,311,441 oysters. No oysters were caught
from 1892 to 1902, inclusive. In 1903, the fishery was profitable,
yielding 41,180,137 oysters, and the share of the government
amounted to £55,303; and in 1904 the yield was almost the same,
being 41,039,085 oysters and a revenue of £71,050 to the government.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1905 occurred the greatest fishery in the modern history of
Ceylon. The season extended from February 20 until April 21, giving
forty-seven working days, exclusive of Sundays and five days of bad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>weather, the longest period in over half a century.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c017'><sup>[131]</sup></a> The boats employed
numbered 318, with 4991 divers and 4894 attendant <i>manduks</i>.
The yield of oysters exceeded all records, amounting to 81,580,716 in
number, or nearly twice as many as in any previous year within the
period of British occupation. The prices at which these sold ranged
from Rs.24 to Rs.124 per thousand, with an average of Rs.48.89 for
the entire season. The government received Rs.2,510,727 as its share
of the revenue, which was twice as much as in any previous year since
the British have been in control, and doubtless the largest received by
any government in the history of the industry. The oysters falling to
the share of the divers must have sold for at least Rs.1,255,363 (since
1881 the divers have received one third of the catch as their compensation,
instead of one fourth). The profits of the merchants, who
purchased and opened the government oysters as well as those of the
divers, doubtless amounted to fully as much, making a total of
Rs.5,021,453, or nearly $2,000,000 as a low estimate of the local value
of the pearls secured at Ceylon in 1905.</p>

<p class='c013'>Owing to the great success in 1905, an enormous number of persons
flocked to the camp at the beginning of the season in 1906. Employment
was given to 473 boats, the largest number on record, and over
8600 divers were engaged, with an equal number of attendants.
Owing to unfavorable weather and the great quantity of oysters removed
in 1905, the catch in 1906 was less than in that record year,
amounting to 67,150,641 in number, from the sale of which Rs.1,376,746
was realized. The prices covered a wide range. For the large
Cheval oysters, even Rs.276, Rs.291, and Rs.309 per 1000 were
received. The inferior, stunted oysters from the Muttuvaratu paar
ranged from Rs.20 to Rs.41 per 1000, and even at these prices many
buyers sustained losses. On the other hand considerable money was
made by the buyers of those from Cheval, in which some very large
and beautiful pearls were found.</p>

<p class='c013'>The results of the 1907 fishery were surprisingly good, excellent
prices being obtained. The proceeds from the sale of two thirds of
the 21,000,000 oysters amounted to Rs.1,040,000, or just under $350,000.
The fishery lasted thirty-six working days. Only 173 boats were
used, as it was considered that a fleet of this size is fully as large as
can be employed advantageously to the greatest satisfaction of all interested.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to the compilations of the colonial secretary’s office, the
gross revenue to the government from 1796 to 1907, inclusive,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>amounted to £2,098,830. If to this be added the fishermen’s share
and the merchants’ compensation, we have a total of about £4,200,000
or $21,000,000 as the local value of the pearls produced in Ceylon during
the period of British occupation. The value of these in the markets
of Asia and Europe was undoubtedly very much greater.</p>

<p class='c013'>In many respects the Ceylon pearl fisheries are the most interesting
in the world. Owing to their ready accessibility and thorough organization,
they are far better known than any others. Reliable data
exist as to the number of oysters taken during each season since 1854,
and it is possible to estimate roughly the pearls obtained therefrom.
Throughout the 112 years of British occupation, and previously to
some extent under the successive rule of the Cingalese kings, of the
Portuguese, and of the Dutch, for centuries, the reefs were annually
examined by official inspectors, and fishing was permitted only in those
years when they appeared in satisfactory condition.</p>

<p class='c013'>A noticeable feature of these fisheries is their uncertainty, a prosperous
season being followed by an absence of fishing sometimes extending
over ten years or more. This is not of recent development.
Over eight hundred years ago a total cessation of yield for a considerable
period was recorded<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c017'><sup>[132]</sup></a> by Albyrouni, who served under Mahmud
of Ghazni. He stated that, in the eleventh century, the oysters which
formerly existed in the Gulf of Serendib (Ceylon) disappeared simultaneously
with the appearance of a fishery at Sofala in the country of
the Zends, where previously the existence of pearls had been unknown;
hence it was conjectured that the pearl-oysters of Serendib
had migrated to Sofala.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the 249 years since Ceylon passed from the dominion of the Portuguese
in 1658, there have been only sixty-nine years in which the
pearl fisheries were prosecuted. During the last century there were
only thirty-six regularly authorized fisheries. Enormous quantities
of oysters have appeared on the reefs, giving rise to hopes of great
results, only to end in disappointment, owing to their complete disappearance.
In the fall of 1887, for instance, examination of one of the
reefs revealed an enormous quantity of oysters, covering an area five
miles in length by one and a half miles in width, with “600 to 700
oysters to the square yard” in places. It was estimated by the inspection
officials that there were 164,000,000 oysters, which exceeded the
total number taken in the preceding sixty years, and which should
have yielded several million dollars’ worth of pearls in the following
season, according to the usual returns. But some months later not an
oyster was to be found on this large reef, the great host presumably
having been destroyed by action of the sea. Numerous reasons are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>assigned for the failure of promising reefs. Those most frequently
heard are that the currents sweep the oysters away, that they are devoured
by predaceous enemies, that they are covered by the shifting
bottom, or that they voluntarily move to new grounds.</p>

<p class='c013'>The oysters are found in well-known and permanently located
banks or paars in the upper end of the Gulf of Manaar, in the wide shallow
plateau off the northwest end of the island and directly south of
Adams Bridge. The hard calcrete bottom is formed mostly of sand
combined with organic remains in a compact mass and with more or
less coral and shell deposits. The density of the water, as determined
by Professor Herdman (to whose important and valuable report<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c017'><sup>[133]</sup></a> we
are indebted for much information), is fairly constant at 1.023, and
the temperature has a normal range of from 82° to 86° F. during the
greater part of the year. The charts and records refer to about
twenty paars, but most of these have never yielded extensively, either
to the English or to the Dutch. In the aggregate, they cover an area
fifty miles in length and twenty miles in width. Most of them are from
five to twenty miles from the shore, and at a depth of five to ten fathoms.
The principal paars are Cheval, Madaragam, Periya, Muttuvaratu,
Karativu, Vankalai, Chilaw, and Condatchy. Only three have
afforded profitable fisheries in recent years, <i>i. e.</i>: Cheval, Madaragam
and Muttuvaratu.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other paars are of practically no economic value at the present
time. They become populated with tens of millions of oysters, which
mysteriously disappear before they are old enough for gathering. Especially
is this true of the Periya paar, which is about fifteen miles
from the shore, and runs eleven miles north and south, varying from
one to two miles in width. Frequently this is found covered with
young oysters, which almost invariably disappear before the next inspection,
owing, probably, to their being covered by the shifting bottom
caused by the southwest monsoon. The natives call this the
“Mother paar,” under the impression that these oysters migrate to the
other paars.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Ceylon government has given very careful attention to all matters
affecting the prosperity of the pearl resources. It has maintained
a “Pearl Fishery Establishment,” consisting of a superintendent, an inspector
and numerous divers, attendants, and sailors. The inspector
examines the paars, determines when and to what extent they should
be fished, and directs the operations. The superintendent conducts
the work on shore, divides and sells the oysters, etc. The expense of
this establishment has approximated $40,000 per annum when there
has been a fishery, and about $22,500 without fishery expenses.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>It has been decided by naturalists that Ceylon oysters less than four
years old produce very few marketable pearls; in the fifth, and again
in the sixth year the value of the yield doubles, and in the seventh it is
supposed to increase fourfold. Beyond that age there appears to be
little increase, and there is the risk of the oysters dying, and of the
pearls deteriorating or becoming lost. Eight years seems to be the
natural limit of life. While experience has shown that the most profitable
period for taking the pearl-oysters is when they are from five
to seven years old, the mollusks are liable to disappear, especially after
the fifth year, and the danger of waiting too long is as great as that of
beginning too early. The fishing on any particular bank is determined
by various circumstances and conditions, and is permitted only
after careful examination.</p>

<p class='c013'>The different beds are inspected from time to time, and no fishing
is permitted until the condition of the pearl-oysters on the particular
reef thrown open seems to warrant the most valuable returns. In the
examination of a bed apparently in suitable condition, several thousand
oysters—usually eight or ten thousand—are taken up and the
pearls found therein are examined and valued. If they average Rs.25
or Rs.30 per thousand oysters, profitable results may be expected, provided
there is a sufficient quantity of oysters on the bed. This method
of determining the fishery is very ancient. Tavernier wrote, about
1650, “before they fish, they try whether it will turn to any account by
sending seven or eight boats to bring 1000 oysters each, which they
open, and if the oysters per 1000 yield five <i>fanos</i> or above, they then
know the fishing will turn to account.”<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c017'><sup>[134]</sup></a> And much the same method
was described by Ribeiro in 1685.</p>

<p class='c013'>When it has been decided to hold a fishery, public notice is given by
advertisement, stating which of the many paars or reefs will be open,
and the estimated quantity of oysters to be removed, the number of
boats that will be given employment, and the date for beginning the
season and the length of time it will probably last. This notice is usually
given in December preceding the fishery, and it is the signal for
preparation by tens of thousands of persons in this part of Asia, and
especially on the Madras and the Malabar coasts of India, and on the
coast of Arabia. The fishermen, the merchants, and the multitude of
artisans, mechanics, and laborers who contribute to the industry, set
their homes and business in order so that they may attend. We give
the notice issued in 1907, both in Cingalese and in English.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c017'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p>THE LATE MAHARAJAH OF PATIALA</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Early in February the area to be gleaned is again examined, the
limits of the oysters are charted and buoyed off, the number that may
be obtained is estimated as accurately as possible, and valuation
samples are collected. Several thousand oysters are taken up, the
pearls are removed, examined, and valued by uninterested experts, and
the results are published, so that prospective buyers may have a reliable
idea as to their value. Otherwise this would not be possible
until the merchants had washed some of their own purchases, which
ordinarily would not be for a week or ten days after the opening of the
season.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fishery usually begins late in February or early in March, as
the sea is then relatively calm, the currents least perceptible, and there
is less danger of storms. It is prosecuted from a temporary settlement
or camp on the sandy shore at a place conveniently near the reefs.
The important fisheries of the five years ending in 1907, were centered
at the improvised settlement known as Marichchikadde. Although
prosecuted from the coast of Ceylon, relatively few Cingalese attend
compared with the large numbers who assemble from India, Arabia,
and elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c013'>A week or two before the opening of the season, the boats begin to
arrive, sometimes fifty or more in a single day, laden with men, women
and children, and in many cases with the materials for their huts. In a
short time the erstwhile desolate beach becomes populated with thousands
of persons from all over the Indian littoral, and there is the
noisy traffic of congregated humanity, and a confusion of tongues
where before only the sound of the ocean waves was heard. Beside
the eight or ten thousand fishermen, most of whom are Moormen,
Tamils, and Arabs, there are pearl merchants—mainly Chetties and
Moormen, boat repairers and other mechanics, provision dealers,
priests, pawnbrokers, government officials, koddu-counters, clerks,
boat guards, a police force of 200 officials, coolies, domestic servants,
with numbers of women and children. And for the entertainment of
these, and to obtain a share of the wealth from the sea, there are jugglers,
fakirs, gamblers, beggars, female dancers, loose characters, with
every allurement that appeals to the sons of Brahma, Buddha or Mohammed.
Natives from the seaport towns of India are there in thousands;
the slender-limbed and delicate-featured Cingalese with their
scant attire and unique head-dress; energetic Arabs from the Persian
Gulf; burly Moormen, sturdy Kandyans, outcast Veddahs, Chinese,
Jews, Portuguese, Dutch, half-castes, the scum of the East and the
riffraff of the Asiatic littoral, the whole making up a temporary city
of forty thousand or more inhabitants.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c017'><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

    <div>THE</div>
    <div>Ceylon Company of Pearl Fishers,</div>
    <div>LIMITED.</div>
    <div class='c003'>NOTICE</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c033'>Is hereby given that a Pearl Fishery will take place at
Marichchukkaddi, in the Island of Ceylon, on or about
February 20, 1907.</p>

<p class='c034'>The Banks to be fished are—</p>

<p class='c034'>The Karativu, Dutch Moderagam and Alanturai Pars,
estimated to contain 21,000,000 oysters, sufficient to employ
100 boats for twenty-one days with average loads of 10,000
each per day.</p>

<p class='c034'>The Northwest and Mid-West Cheval, estimated to
contain 2,000,000 oysters, sufficient to employ 100 boats for
two days with average loads of 10,000 oysters.</p>

<p class='c034'>The Muttuvaratu Par, estimated to contain 8,000,000
oysters, sufficient to employ 100 boats for eight days with
average loads as before stated: each boat being fully manned
with divers.</p>

<p class='c034'>2. It is notified that fishing will begin on the first
favourable day after February 19. Conditions governing the
employment of divers will be issued separately.</p>

<p class='c034'>3. Marichchukkaddi is on the mainland, eight miles
by sea south of Sillavaturai, and supplies of good water and
provisions can be obtained there.</p>

<p class='c034'>4. The Fishery will be conducted on account of the
Ceylon Company of Pearl Fishers, Ltd., and the oysters put
up to sale in such lots as may be deemed expedient.</p>

<div id='i_111'  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>
<img src='images/i_111.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>A populous town springs up with well-planned and lighted streets
and vast numbers of temporary abodes of all sorts, according to the
means and the caste of the occupants, some of them just large enough
for two or three persons to creep into. Although made mostly of
poles, mats, <i>cajans</i> or plaited fronds of the cocoanut tree, they furnish
ample shelter for the locality and season, the uncertainty of the fishery
from year to year being sufficient argument against expensive and
substantial buildings. Numerous wells and cisterns yield water for
the use of all. Sanitary measures are strictly enforced, with a liberal
use of disinfectants. At a considerable distance southward from the
settlement are constructed the private <i>toddis</i>, or inclosures, for decomposing
the oysters and washing the pearls therefrom. Nearer the
camp or settlement itself are the police court, the jail, the bank, the
post and telegraph offices, the auction room, the hospital and the
cemetery—all to endure through a strenuous six weeks of toil and
labor, of money-getting and gambling, and then the inhabitants “fold
their tents like the Arabs, and silently steal away,” leaving the debris
to the shore-birds and the jackals.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fishing fleet consists of several hundred boats<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c017'><sup>[137]</sup></a> of various rigs
and sizes. These are interesting on account of their picturesque appearance
and also their remarkable diversity of types in hull and rigging:
there is the broad and roomy Jaffna dhoney, commonly painted
black; the lugger-like Paumben boat; the very narrow and speedy
canoes,—not unlike the single masted bugeyes of the Chesapeake
region—from Kilakarai and neighboring villages, most noticeable
owing to their great number and their bright colors—red, green, or
yellow; the clumsy looking, single masted Tuticorin lighters, sharp
sterned and copper bottomed, the largest boats in the fleet, ranging in
capacity from twenty to forty tons each; and, most singular of all, the
three masted great canoes from Adirampatnam and Muttupat on the
Tanjore coast, pale blue in color and with curved prow. In addition to
these standard types, added novelty is imparted by a few boats of design
so odd and fantastic as would be conceived only by the mind of an
oriental builder.</p>

<p class='c013'>Reaching the camp at the beginning of the season, these boats are
examined by the officials as to condition and equipment and, if found
satisfactory, are registered and numbered. When the quantity of
oysters to be removed is small, many more boats may arrive than is
necessary or than can find profitable employment. Formerly when
this occurred a lottery was held to determine those to be employed.
More recently the officials have endeavored to engage all boats passing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the inspection, although to do so might necessitate arranging the fleet
into two divisions, each fishing on alternate days. In 1874, the boats
were arranged in three divisions, the red, blue and green, with fifty
boats in each; in 1879, and again in 1881, there were two divisions, the
red and the blue; and likewise in 1880, in 1903 and in 1906 there were
two, the red and the white divisions. Of the 318 boats employed in the
1905 fishery, 143 were from Kilakarai, seventy-four from Jaffna,
thirty-five from Tuticorin, thirty-four from Paumben, nine from
Manaar, six from Negapatam, five from Colombo, four each from
Tondi and Kayalpatam, and one each from Devipatam, Adrapatam,
Ammopatam, and Koddaipatam.</p>

<p class='c013'>The number of persons on each boat ranges from about twelve to
sixty-five, with an average for the entire fleet of about thirty-five men
per boat. This includes the <i>sammatti</i>, or master, who represents the
owner; the <i>tindal</i>, or pilot; the <i>todai</i>, or water-bailer, who is very necessary
on these leaky craft, and who also takes charge of the food and
drinking water; at times a government inspector or “boat guard”;
and from five to thirty divers, with an equal number of <i>manducks</i>, or
attendants.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c017'><sup>[138]</sup></a> The <i>sammattis</i>, <i>tindals</i>, and <i>todais</i> are nearly all from
the coast of southern India. The “boat guards” or inspectors are
natives of Ceylon, and are employed by the government to prevent the
fishermen from opening the oysters. Most of the <i>manducks</i> are from
the Indian coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the 4991 divers employed in 1905, 2649 were Moormen or Lubbais
from Kilakarai, Tondi, etc., on the Madura coast; 923 were
Arabs; 424 were Erukkalampiddi Moormen from Ceylon, and the
remaining 995 were Tamils from Tuticorin, Rameswaram and elsewhere
on the Madras coast, Malayalans from the Malabar coast, with
small numbers from other localities on the Asiatic coasts.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the 8600 divers in 1906, were 4090 Arabs, the largest number
of those people employed in recent years. In 1905 there were only
923 Arab divers, in 1904 only 238, and previously the number was
much less. Some have worked on the Ceylon coast since 1887, but
most of them are newly arrived from Bahrein and Kuweit, where they
received their training as pearl-divers. They are very energetic and
skilful fishermen, far surpassing the Tamils, coming early in the season
and staying late, and working on many days when rough seas
deter the Indian divers from venturing out.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Erukkalampiddi divers of Ceylon are by no means so energetic
or steady in work as the Arabs, and commonly desert the fishery before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>the close. The Tamil divers belong to the Parawa and Kadeiyar
castes.</p>

<p class='c013'>The season in the Ceylon fishery is very short, only about six or
eight weeks at the most; and the holidays and storms usually reduce
the number of actual working days to less than thirty. In no other
pearl fishery of importance is the season less than four months in
length, and in most of them it extends through more than half of the
year. Owing to this restricted time, there is greater activity in the
Ceylon fishery compared with the value of the output than in any
other pearl fishery in the world.</p>

<p class='c013'>Although the season is short, it is strenuous. Arising shortly
after midnight, the thousands of fishermen breakfast, perform their
devotions and prepare to get under way so as to reach the reefs about
sunrise. There each boat takes its position on the ground allotted for
the day’s work, and which has been marked in advance by buoys
topped with flags; and shortly afterward, on a signal from the guard
vessel, the diving commences. This is carried on in the same manner
as already described for the Persian Gulf, except that the Indian
divers do not use nose-clips, only compressing the nostrils with the
fingers during the descent. Rarely do they descend to a greater depth
than ten fathoms.</p>

<p class='c013'>The divers work in pairs, each pair using a single diving stone in
common, and descending alternately, precisely as in the Persian Gulf.
It is remarkable what few changes have occurred in the methods of
the fishery in the last six centuries; the description<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c017'><sup>[139]</sup></a> of Marco Polo,
who visited the region about 1294, and of writers somewhat more
recent, indicating that, in the main features, it was then conducted in
the same manner as at the present time.</p>

<p class='c013'>An exception to the usual mode of diving is practised by the Malayalam
fishermen, who, in some seasons—as in 1903, for instance—attend
in large numbers from Travancore and northward on the Malabar
coast. These men are rather low in skill and physical endurance.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c017'><sup>[140]</sup></a>
They dive head foremost from a spring-board, and even with this
assistance,—or possibly we should say, handicapped by this method,—they
find the average depth of eight fathoms too great for them to
work in with much comfort, rarely remaining under water longer than
forty-five seconds.</p>

<p class='c013'>The number of oysters secured on each visit to the bottom ranges
from nothing to seventy-five or more, averaging between fifteen
and fifty. This depends not only on the ability of the fishermen, but
also on the abundance of oysters and the ease with which they may
be collected. Sometimes they are held together in loose bunches of
five to ten in each, and a diver can easily gather one hundred in the
short length of time he remains submerged. In other localities they
may be somewhat firmly attached individually to the bottom, so that
some force is necessary to release them, thus reducing the possible
quantity. Ordinarily one dive clears a space of several square yards.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Since 1904, a steamer has been employed each season by the government
for dredging oysters in connection with experiments in oyster-culture.
The officer in charge of this work concludes that “dredging
is economically a more sound method of fishing than is diving.”<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c017'><sup>[141]</sup></a> This
view is disputed by the superintendent of the fishery, who points out
that the average catch by the steamer when dredging mature oysters
only slightly exceeds that of an ordinary diving boat, and the cost of
maintenance and operation is vastly greater.<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c017'><sup>[142]</sup></a> A remarkable tribute to
the skill of the nude divers, brought out by this discussion, is that,
during some days when they were at work, the sea was too rough for
dredging by the steamer, notwithstanding that she was a typical
Grimsby or North Sea trawler of 150 tons measurement, built in 1896.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c017'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A rough comparison of the Ceylon method of catching pearl-oysters
with that practised by the American oyster-growers may not be uninteresting.
On a basis of 400 to the bushel, the total Ceylon catch of
81,580,716 pearl-oysters in 1905 represents a trifle more than 200,000
bushels, or about the quantity annually produced by each of the half
dozen leading oyster-growers of this country. Each one of these
growers requires only about three steamers, at a total cost, maybe, of
$25,000, and manned by twenty-five men; instead of one steamer at a
cost of $25,000 and 318 diving boats manned by 10,000 men, which was
the equipment in Ceylon. To be sure, the conditions under which the
work is prosecuted are different—however, not so entirely unlike as
might be supposed—and the American season is about six months long
instead of the two months in Ceylon; but the comparison is presented
simply as a suggestion of the possibilities of dredging on the Ceylon
reefs.</p>

<p class='c013'>Until 1885, one of the most novel features of the fishery was the
employment of shark-charmers or “binders of sharks” (<i>kadal-kotti</i>
in the Tamil language, <i>hai-banda</i> in Hindustani), whose presence
was rendered necessary by the superstition of the Indian divers. The
fishermen placed implicit reliance upon the alleged supernatural powers
of these impostors, resembling in some respects that reposed in the
“medicine men” by the American Indians, and would not dive without
their supervision. It is unknown at what period the influence of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>semi-priests developed, but at the time of Marco Polo’s visit about
1294, they were in the full bloom of their authority, receiving one
twentieth of the total catch of oysters,<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c017'><sup>[144]</sup></a> which amounted to a very
considerable sum. It is probable that the number of shark-charmers
was then quite large, some writers more recently referring to one for
each boat. During the Portuguese occupation the number was reduced
to twelve, and at the beginning of the British influence, it was
further reduced to two.</p>

<p class='c013'>Interesting descriptions have been given of the methods by which
these men exercised their alleged powers. In 1807, Cordiner stated:</p>

<p class='c020'>One goes out regularly in the head pilot’s boat. The other performs certain
ceremonies on shore. He is stripped naked, and shut up in a room, where no
person sees him from the period of the sailing of the boats until their return.
He has before him a brass basin full of water, containing one male and one
female fish made of silver. If any accident should happen from a shark at
sea, it is believed that one of these fishes is seen to bite the other. The divers
likewise believe that, if the conjurer should be dissatisfied, he has the power of
making the sharks attack them, on which account he is sure of receiving
liberal presents from all quarters.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c017'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Amusing stories are told of the shrewdness displayed by these fellows
in inventing explanations to redeem their credit when a fisherman
became a victim of the sharks. These accounts are by men who
evidently bore no good-will toward the shark-charmers, and it would
be of interest to hear from the other side; but we have been unable to
find any one who has appeared in print in their defense.</p>

<p class='c013'>The British government, in its policy of noninterference with the
superstitions or semi-religious customs of the natives, tolerated these
seeming impostors, owing, probably, in a measure, to the fact that the
superstitious belief in their necessity was favorable to the preservation
of the resources, since it restricted poaching on the reefs. However,
the government endeavored to prevent an extravagant misuse of the
influence, and restricted the compensation of the shark-charmers to
one oyster per day from each diver. Later, they were remunerated by
the government, and were not allowed, under any pretense whatever,
to demand, exact, or receive oysters or any other compensation from
the boatmen, divers, or any other persons. And, finally, in 1885, the
shark-charmers were done away with entirely, after having exacted
their toll for upward of six centuries at least.</p>

<p class='c013'>The dangers to which the Ceylon divers are exposed have been
greatly exaggerated, and especially the risks from sharks. Poets tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>how “the Ceylon pearler went all naked to the hungry shark,” and
the struggle of the diver has been a favorite theme with sensational
writers. As a matter of fact, the trouble from this source is very
slight, and the occupation is less dangerous than that of most of
the deep-water fisheries, not to be compared, for instance, with that of
the winter haddock-fishery off the New England coast. Even in 1905,
when 4991 divers and an equal number of assistants were employed in
pearling, not a single fatal accident was reported, and although much
rough weather prevailed, not a fishing boat was lost. In the important
fishery of 1904, with 3049 divers, only one fatal accident occurred,
this was an elderly Moorman, whose death at the bottom was apparently
due either to apoplexy or to exhaustion from remaining under
water too long.</p>

<p class='c013'>The superintendent of the fishery reported that not a single shark
was seen during the 1904 season.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c017'><sup>[146]</sup></a> According to the statement of Sir
William Twynam, whose Ceylon pearl fishing experience and observation
equal those of any European, he has never known of a diver being
carried off by a shark, and has heard of only one case—“which was a
very doubtful one.”<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c017'><sup>[147]</sup></a> Prof. James Hornell, the inspector of pearl
banks, reported in 1904: “During all the months I have spent upon
the pearl banks during the last two years and a half I have never
had a glimpse of a shark dangerous to man. Several times the boatmen
have caught basking sharks of considerable size, but all were of a
species that lives almost entirely upon small crustaceans.”<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c017'><sup>[148]</sup></a> The late
Mr. A. M. Ferguson wrote in 1887: “I think it is pretty certain that in
the whole course of the Ceylon fisheries only two human beings have
fallen victims to these fierce fishes.”<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c017'><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The diving continues until a signal is given from the guard vessel
about twelve or one o’clock, this time depending largely on the beginning
of the sea breeze which roughens the water and interferes with
the work, and likewise serves to speed the passage of the sail vessels
to the shore. Occasionally the breeze is unfavorable, and the boatmen
are obliged to row for miles, delaying their return in some instances
until nightfall. Then the shore is lighted up to guide them to the
landings, and extra precautions are maintained to prevent them from
getting away with some of the oysters in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is claimed—and doubtless with much truth—that it is not unusual
for the boatmen to take advantage of the time spent in reaching the
shore to surreptitiously open many of the oysters and extract the
pearls therefrom, throwing the refuse back into the sea. It would appear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>from some authorities that this is a general practice. One official—and
probably the one in the best position to know—reported in 1905
that more than 15,000,000 oysters, or nearly one fifth of the enormous
catch during that season, were illicitly opened.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c017'><sup>[150]</sup></a> However, this statement
is strongly disputed by the superintendent of the fishery, who
states:</p>

<p class='c020'>As a matter of fact the opening of oysters that goes on in the boats is of
a much more casual description than this. The divers occasionally pick out
some of the best looking oysters that happen to be conspicuous, or some that
open, and look inside them. It is quite possible that a valuable pearl might be
found in this way, but the chances are against it. It is hardly likely that the
divers would throw into the sea an enormous quantity of perfunctorily examined
oysters in which they have a share and which contain pearls, while
they were aware that immediately on landing they could get good prices for
their shares.<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c017'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The government officials have endeavored to put a stop to whatever
looting may exist, searching boats and occupants at the shore, revoking
the license of any boat showing evidence of oysters having been opened
or carrying knives or other appliances for that purpose. The fishermen
are alleged to resort to all sorts of devices to secrete their illicit
find of pearls, concealing them in the nose, ears, eyes, and other parts
of the body, and even hiding them in parcels in the furled sails or attached
to the embedded anchor. In some seasons—as in 1904 and
1905—the government employed a guard for each boat. But serious
criticism has been made of the integrity of these guards, who, with
compensation of only one rupee per diem, could scarcely be expected
to resist the action of thirty or forty fishermen and report their doings,
when by silence they would have much to gain, and “the guards simply
add to the number of thieves on board” was reported by one superintendent.</p>

<p class='c013'>Doubtless the most interesting sight in the Ceylon fishery is afforded
by the return, about mid-afternoon, of the hundreds of novel,
sail-spreading boats running before the wind and crowded with turbaned
fishermen dressed in their few brilliant rags, and each anxious
to be the first at the wave-washed beach, where they are welcomed by
an equal if not greater number of officials, merchants, laborers, and
camp followers, gathered on the shore to learn the result of the fishery.
The fantastic appearance of the boats, the diversified costumes of the
people, the general scene of animation, afford a view which for novelty
is rarely equaled even in the picturesque Orient.</p>

<p class='c013'>The average number of oysters brought in daily by each boat is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>about 10,000. Some days when the weather is unfavorable many of
the boats return empty; on other days they may have 25,000 or more.
In 1905 the maximum catch in one day for one boat was 29,990, while
in 1904 a single boat brought in 37,675 oysters. The catch by the entire
fleet one day in 1905 was 4,978,686 oysters, or an average of
16,485 for each of the 302 boats out on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Each person taking part in the fishery receives as his compensation
a definite portion of the oysters. By government regulations, published
in 1855 and yet operative, each <i>sammatti</i>, <i>tindal</i>, and <i>todai</i> receives
daily one dive of oysters from each diver in the boat to which
they are respectively attached. In some instances the hire of the boat
is paid for in cash—about Rs.1.50 per day from each diver,—but in
most cases either one fifth or one sixth of each diver’s portion is devoted
to this purpose. After these provisions have been made, each
diver gives one third of his remaining portion to his <i>manduck</i>, retaining
the balance for himself. The Moormen divers from Kilakarai
commonly contribute one dive daily to the mosque of their native
town,<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c017'><sup>[152]</sup></a> in addition to the portions given to the <i>sammatti</i>, <i>tindal</i>, and <i>todai</i>.
Previous to 1855, the Hindu temples of the Madras Presidency
were allowed to operate a certain number of boats on their own account,
but this led to so many abuses that it was abolished.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the boats are run up on the firm, hard beach, all the oysters are
removed by the crews of the boats into the government <i>koddu</i> or palisade,
a large wattle-walled and palm-thatched inclosure with square
pens, each bearing a number corresponding to that of each boat. This
is done under close supervision to prevent a diversion of the oysters
from the regular channels, which otherwise would be relatively easy
among the animation and excitement caused by the thousands of persons
about the landing-place.</p>

<p class='c013'>Within the government inclosure, the oysters taken by each boat are
divided by the fishermen themselves into three portions as nearly equal
as possible. This applies not only to the oysters falling to the share of
the divers and <i>manducks</i>, but also to those set apart for the <i>sammatti</i>,
<i>tindals</i>, and <i>todais</i>, for hire of the boat and even for the Kilakarai
mosque. An official indicates one of these as the share of the fishermen,
who at once remove their portion from the inclosure through a
narrow gate on the landward side. By this arrangement a satisfactory
division of the oysters is secured and all cause for complaint or
unfairness is removed. Previous to 1881, the fishermen received only
one fourth of the catch as compensation for their work; but in that
year their portion was increased to one third, at which it has since remained.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>As soon as the fishermen pass out of the government <i>koddu</i> with
their quota, they are met by a crowd of natives eager to buy the oysters
in small lots, and frequently at so many per rupee—ranging from eight
to twelve ordinarily. This “outside market” is one of the many interesting
features of the camp, for there are few persons on the shore
who do not risk small sums in testing their fortunes in this lottery.
And a wonderful lottery it is too, in which a man may risk a few coppers
and win a prize worth hundreds of dollars. A poor Tamil once
bought five oysters for half a rupee, and in one of them he found the
largest pearl of the season. Any not sold among this eager, animated
throng are at once marketed with a native buyer. The diver then
hastens to immerse himself in one of the bathing tanks provided for
the purpose. It is claimed that if this bath is omitted after immersion
all the morning in the salt water of the gulf, the diver is liable to fall
ill; and a sufficient supply of fresh water for this purpose is an important
factor in the arrangement of the camp.</p>

<p class='c013'>Owing to their sale in much smaller lots, or as we may say, at
retail, the fishermen succeed in getting relatively high prices for their
oysters, and their earnings exceed one half of the government’s share.
In 1905 this amounted to probably £86,000, or an average of about
$1350 for each of the 318 boats. However, some crews made very
much more than this, with a corresponding decrease for the others.
Although 1905 was a record year for large returns, even in an ordinary
season pearl fishing is relatively profitable, as a skilled diver
earns five or six times as much as a common laborer in Ceylon. The
regulations particularly forbid the employment of divers for a monetary
consideration instead of for a share of the oysters according to
the established custom.</p>

<p class='c013'>The remaining two thirds of the oysters in the <i>koddu</i> are the
property of the government. These are combined and counted. At
nine o’clock each evening they are sold at auction, and by noon of the
following day all have been removed, and the inclosure is ready for
the incoming catch.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the auction the number of oysters to be sold that evening is announced,
and bids are invited. Some one starts the bidding at, maybe,
Rs.20 or 25, and this is advanced by successive bids until the limit appears
to be reached, which may possibly be Rs.50 or 60. The successful
bidder is permitted to take as many oysters in multiples of 1000
as he chooses; and after he is supplied, other merchants desiring them
at that particular price are accommodated. If there is no further demand
for them at that price, the bidding on the remaining oysters is
begun precisely as at first, and when the maximum bid is reached, all
merchants willing to give that amount are furnished with as many as
they wish in multiples of 1000 as before. If this does not exhaust the
oysters, the bidding on the remainder is started up again, and so on
until all are sold.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c017'><sup>[153]</sup></a> No one knows at the time whether he is buying a
fortune in gems or only worthless shells.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>The prices at which the oysters are sold at auction may differ greatly
from the estimated valuation of the samples secured in the February
examination. For instance, in 1905 the valuation of the South Madaragam
oysters was Rs.17.86 per 1000, yet the auction sales on the
first day began at Rs.53 and went up to Rs.61 per 1000, or three
times the valuation; and about the same general proportion of increase
prevailed for the oysters from the remaining banks, a result of great
advances in the market for pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>The auction prices for the different lots and from day to day are
fairly constant. But the shrewd Indian merchants know their business
well and keep in close touch with the yield, so that there are many
variations in the selling price that are puzzling to the uninitiated. A
somewhat higher estimation is placed on the oysters from certain
banks, and also on those from rocky portions of a particular reef,
owing to their reputation for yielding a larger percentage of pearls.
The estimation of particular oysters varies to some extent according to
the amount of adhering rock and coral growth. As already shown,
the prices in 1906 covered the remarkable range of from Rs.20 to
309 per 1000. Superstitious belief in luck also has its influence,
and a buyer may consider a certain day as unfavorable for him and
abstain from bidding on that occasion; or considering a particular
day as lucky, he may bid very high to secure a considerable portion of
the sales.</p>

<p class='c013'>The prices in different seasons vary greatly. In 1860, the average
was Rs.134.23 per 1000, which was unprecedentedly large; the nearest
to this was Rs.79.07 in 1874 and Rs.49 in 1905. In 1880, the average
price per 1000 was only Rs.11, which was the lowest ever recorded.
The records for individual days greatly exceed these limits. The
highest figures at which oysters have sold on any one day was Rs.309
per 1000 in 1906, the equivalent for each oyster of 10½ cents in
American money. In 1874, the price reached Rs.210 per 1000, and in
1905, the maximum price was Rs.124, or about 4¼ cents for each
oyster.</p>

<p class='c013'>The oyster-buyers are principally wealthy Chetties from Madura,
Ramnad, Trichinopoli, Parambakudi, Tevakoddai, Paumben, Kumbhakonam,
and other towns of southern India. These are quite different
from the scantily clothed Naddukoddai Chetties so common in
Ceylon. Many of them are fashionably dressed in semi-European
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>costume, with walking-stick, patent leather boots, and other evidences
of contact with Europe. Smaller quantities of oysters are purchased
by Moormen of Kilakarai, Ramnad, Bombay, Adrampatam, Tondi,
etc. A few oysters are also purchased by the Nadans or Chánár caste
people of Perunali, Kamuti, and Karakal. Over 99 per cent. of the
50,346,601 oysters sold by the government in 1905 were secured by
Indian buyers, and less than one per cent. by Cingalese. A few of the
oysters—from two to five per cent.—are sent to Indian and Ceylon
ports, but most of them are opened at the fishing camp.</p>

<p class='c013'>The purchaser of only a small number of oysters may open them at
once by means of a knife, and with his fingers and eyes search for the
pearls. By this method very small pearls may be easily overlooked,
and it is scarcely practicable in handling large quantities of oysters.
These are removed to private inclosures known as <i>toddis</i> or <i>tottis</i>,
situated some distance from the inhabited portions of the camp; where,
exposed to the solar heat, they are permitted to putrefy, and the fleshy
parts to be eaten by the swarms of big red-eyed bluebottle flies, and the
residue is then repeatedly washed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shakspere may have had in view some such scene as this when he
spoke of the “pearl in your foul oyster.” The lady who cherishes and
adorns herself with a necklace of Ceylon pearls would be horrified
were she to see and especially to smell the putrid mass from which her
lustrous gems are evolved. The great quantity of repulsive bluebottle
flies are so essential to success in releasing the pearls from the flesh,
that a scarcity of them is looked upon as a misfortune to the merchants.
However, except it may be at the beginning of a fishery, there is rarely
ever a cause for complaint on this score, for commonly they are so
numerous as to be a great plague to persons unaccustomed to them,
covering everything, and rendering eating and drinking a difficult and
unpleasant necessity, until darkness puts a stop to their activities. But
the intolerable stench, impossible of description, the quintessence of
millions of rotting oysters, fills the place, and makes existence a burden
to those who have not acquired odor-proof nostrils. This animal decomposition
seems almost harmless to health; indeed, the natives evidently
thrive on it, and eat and sleep without apparent notice of the
nauseous conditions. And yet vegetable decomposition in this region
is usually followed by fatal results. Notwithstanding sanitary precautions
and the usual quarantine camp and hospitals, cholera occasionally
becomes epidemic and puts a stop to the fishery, as was the
case in 1889; but this probably was due more to the violation of ordinary
sanitary laws than to the decaying oysters.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a large <i>toddi</i> the oysters are placed in a <i>ballam</i>, or a dug-out
tank or trough, fifteen or twenty feet long and two or three feet deep,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>smooth on the inside so that pearls may not lodge in the crevices. This
tank is covered with matting, and the <i>toddi</i> is closed up, sealed, and
guarded for a week or ten days, when the fly maggots will have consumed
practically all of the flesh tissues, leaving little else than the
shells and pearls. The tank is then filled with sea water to float out
the myriads of maggots. Several nude coolies squat along the sides
to wash and remove the shells. The valves of each shell are separated,
the outsides rubbed together to remove all lodgments for pearls, and
the interior examined for attached or encysted pearls. The washers
are kept under constant supervision by inspectors to prevent concealment
of pearls; they are not permitted to remove their hands from the
water except to take out the shells, and under no circumstances are they
allowed to carry the hands to the mouth or to any other place in which
pearls could be concealed.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the shells have been removed, fresh supplies of water are
added to wash the debris, which is turned over and over repeatedly,
the dirty water being bailed out through sieves to prevent the loss of
pearls. After thorough washings, every particle of the <i>sarraku</i>, or
material at the bottom of the <i>ballam</i>, consisting of sand, broken pieces
of shell, pearls, etc., is gathered up in a cotton cloth. Later the <i>sarraku</i>
is spread out on cloths in the sun to dry, and the most conspicuous
pearls are removed. When dry, the material is critically examined
over and over again, and winnowed and rewinnowed, and after it
seems that everything of value has been secured, the refuse is turned
over to women and children, whose keen eyes and deft fingers pick out
many <i>masi-tul</i> or dust-pearls; and even after the skill of these has been
exhausted, the apparently worthless refuse has a market value among
persons whose patience and skill meets with some reward. It is due
largely to the extreme care in the search that so many seed-pearls are
found in Ceylon.</p>

<p class='c013'>And this leads to a discussion of what is commonly known in Ceylon
as the “Dixon washing machine.” This is an invention of Mr. G.
G. Dixon who constructed it at Marichchikadde in 1904 and 1905,
at a total cost to the government of about Rs.162,000,<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c017'><sup>[154]</sup></a> including all
expenses incidental to the experiment. The machine involves two
separate processes; the first consists in separating the shells from the
soft portion of the oysters, and the second in recovering the pearls
from the resultant <i>sarraku</i> after it has been dried. In 1905, about
5,000,000 oysters were put through this machine,<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c017'><sup>[155]</sup></a> but with what
result has not been announced.</p>

<p class='c013'>The shells having pearls attached to the interior surface are turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>over to skilled natives, who remove the valuable objects by breaking
the shell with hammers, and then with files and other implements
remove the irregular pieces of attached shell and otherwise improve
the appearance.</p>

<p class='c013'>In no fishery in the world is the average size of the pearls secured
smaller, nor is the relative number greater than in that of Ceylon. It
is rare that one is found weighing over ten grains, and the number
weighing less than two grains is remarkable. For roundness and
orient they are unsurpassed by those of any region. However, Ceylon
pearls worth locally Rs.1000 ($400) are by no means abundant. The
most valuable one found in the important fishery of 1904, is said to
have been sold in the camp for Rs.2500. The fishery of 1905 yielded
one weighing 76½ <i>chevu</i>, and valued at Rs.12,000.</p>

<p class='c013'>The quantity of seed-pearls obtained in the Ceylon fishery exceeds
that of any other—probably all other parts of the world. The very
smallest—the <i>masi-tul</i>,—for which there is no use whatever in Europe,
have an established value in India, being powdered for making <i>chunam</i>
for chewing with betel. Those slightly larger,—<i>tul</i> pearls—for
which also there is no market in Europe, are placed in the mouth of
deceased Hindus of wealth, instead of the rice which is used by poorer
people.</p>

<p class='c013'>The great bulk of the Ceylon pearls are silvery white in color, but
occasionally yellowish, pinkish, and even “black” pearls are found, although
the so-called “black” pearls are really brown or slate-colored. In
some seasons these are relatively numerous, as in 1887, for instance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Notwithstanding the large product at the fishery camp, it is difficult
to purchase single pearls or small quantities there at a reasonable
price, the merchants objecting to breaking a <i>mudichchu</i>, or the lot
resulting from washing a definite number of oysters.</p>

<p class='c013'>The shells obtained in the Ceylon fisheries do not possess sufficient
thickness of lustrous nacre for use as mother-of-pearl, and are mostly
used for camp-filling. A few are burned and converted into
<i>chunam</i>, <i>i.e.</i>: prepared lime for building purposes, or to be used by
natives for chewing with the betel-nut. Forty or fifty years ago, before
the large receipts of mother-of-pearl from Australia and the
southern Pacific, there was a good market for the shell for button
manufacture and the like, but since 1875 only the choicest have been
used for this purpose, and these are worth only about $25 per ton
delivered in Europe.</p>

<p class='c013'>It will be observed that up to the close of the season of 1906, the
Ceylon fisheries were operated by the colonial government as a state
monopoly. In 1904, proposals were made to the British colonial office
by a London syndicate with a view to leasing the fisheries for a term
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>of years. The original suggestion was that they should be leased for
thirty years in consideration of an annual rental of £13,000 or Rs.195,000,
together with a share of the net profits after payment of a
reasonable rate of interest on the investment; and later it was suggested
that the rental be Rs.100,000 a year and twenty per cent. of the
profits after seven per cent. on capital had been paid to the shareholders.
But the government preferred a definite money payment
without any rights to share in the profits realized; and after lengthy
negotiations this was fixed at Rs.310,000 annually, with certain preliminary
payments. Accordingly, on November 30, 1905, a preliminary
agreement was executed between the crown agents for the
colonies, acting on behalf of the government of Ceylon, and representatives
of the Ceylon Company of Pearl Fishers, Limited. On February
27, 1906, this agreement was confirmed and made effective by
special ordinance<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c017'><sup>[156]</sup></a> of the governor and legislative council of Ceylon,
and the crown agents were authorized to execute the lease as of
January 1, 1906.</p>

<p class='c013'>The principal financial terms of this lease required the company to
purchase the expensive Dixon pearl-washing machine at a cost of
Rs.120,000, which was Rs.42,000 less than it cost the government
during the preceding two years; to purchase at a cost of Rs.62,501
the steamship <i>Violet</i>, which the government had used in its experimental
oyster-culture; to reimburse the government each year the
amount spent in policing, sanitation and hospital services at the fishery
camp, which had in some individual seasons amounted to more than
Rs.200,000; to expend each year from Rs.50,000 to Rs.150,000 in the
development of pearl-oyster culture; and to pay an annual rental of
Rs.315,000, a rate based roughly on the average return of the preceding
twenty years, including the record year of 1905.</p>

<p class='c013'>The company was authorized to take up the pearl-oysters by means
of divers, or by steam dredges, or by such other mechanical means as
might appear most advantageous, and to carry on such experiments
with the immature oysters as appeared most conducive to the profitable
working of the fisheries, provided they do nothing to make the resources
less valuable at the expiration of the lease.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the most interesting features of the lease is that relating to
the power of the colonial government to grant an exclusive right of
fishing on the banks outside the three-mile limit. The question of this
exclusive right arose in 1890, but was not conclusively determined.
Fearing lest this authority did not exist, the terms in which the
right of fishing was conveyed were carefully chosen by the attorney
general to protect the government from liability “should any international
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>question arise”;<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c017'><sup>[157]</sup></a> and the government leased to the company
“all the right or privilege which the lessors have hereto exercised
and enjoyed of fishing for and taking pearl-oysters on the coasts of
Ceylon between Talaimannar and Dutch Bay Point, to the intent that
the company <i>so far as the lessors can secure the same</i> may have the
exclusive right, liberty and authority to fish for, take and carry away
pearl-oysters within the said limits.... But nothing in this lease
shall be taken to make the lessors answerable in damages if <i>owing to any
cause beyond the control of the lessors</i> the company is prevented from
fully exercising and enjoying such exclusive right and privilege.”<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c017'><sup>[158]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In the meantime, while the negotiations were in progress, there
occurred the very profitable fishery of 1905, from which the colonial
government derived a revenue of Rs.2,510,727, or approximately eight
times the proposed annual rental; and before the lease was finally
concluded occurred the fishery of 1906, with its revenue of Rs.1,376,746.
While it is true that a succession of barren seasons prevailed
from 1892 to 1902, yet, as the revenue in 1903 was Rs.829,548, and in
1904 it was Rs.1,065,751, there was, in the four years ending in 1906,
a revenue to the government of Rs.5,782,772, or nearly as much as
the total amount to be derived from the lease during the twenty years
it was to run. These figures seemed to furnish strong reasons for
retaining such a valuable source of revenue, with its possibilities of
still greater expansion under the supervision and direction of specialists
in the employ of the government.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many of the inhabitants of Ceylon saw in this a decided objection
to the lease, and there was a general feeling of indignation in the
colony, with public meetings in protest, and the like. In reply to a
memorial prepared at one of these meetings held in Colombo, Lord
Elgin, the British secretary of state for the colonies, wrote under date
of May 9, 1906:</p>

<p class='c020'>The memorialists have protested against the lease on the double ground
that a lease on any terms is contrary to the best interests of Ceylon, and that
the rent agreed upon is “under existing circumstances wholly inadequate.”
There must always be in cases of this kind a difference of opinion as to
whether a fixed annual sum, with immunity from all expense and sundry
other advantages, is or is not preferable to continuing to face all the risks for
the sake of all the profits. In the present instance the lease appears to me to
have been drafted with a sincere desire to safeguard to the utmost the property
and interests of the Colony.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>It may be true that the development of the fishery upon a scientific system
affords good prospect of a greater return in the future than has been obtained
in the past, and affords at least the hope that the barren cycles which have
been so common in the past will not recur to the same extent. But the operations
necessary to that end are of a highly technical and experimental character,
and I am very doubtful whether any machinery which could be set in
motion by the Government would be suited to develop processes at once so
doubtful and so delicate. In twenty years’ time the Colonial Government will
receive back the fishery, not only intact, but in the most perfect state to which
commercial enterprise and scientific methods can raise it, and, in the meanwhile,
a regular and substantial payment is assured. Twenty years are no
doubt a considerable period in the lifetime of individuals; but if within that
time all the resources that science can contribute toward systematic development
of the fisheries have been applied and thoroughly tested, the period will
not, I think, be regarded as excessive or unfortunate in the history of a fishery
which has lasted for more than two thousand years.<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c017'><sup>[159]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The Ceylon Company of Pearl Fishers, Limited, with a paid up
capital of £165,000, has just entered into possession of its lease, and it
is uncertain what changes will be made in the methods of the fishery
or what measure of success will follow the attempts at pearl-oyster culture
and the growth of pearls. The attention of the pearling
interests of the world is now directed to the work of this company in
the development of its magnificent leasehold, and it seems not unlikely
that greater changes will be made in the methods of the industry during
the ensuing decade than have occurred in the whole of the last ten
centuries.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c017'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A curious fishery, with the <i>Placuna placenta</i> for its object, exists
in Tablegram Lake, a small bay in northeastern Ceylon adjacent to
the magnificent harbor of Trincomali, which Nelson declared to be
“the finest in the world.” At intervals during the nineteenth century,
the Ceylon government leased the Tablegram Lake fishery to native
bidders for a period of three consecutive years. In 1857, Dr. Kelaart
visited the place and calculated that in the three years preceding, eighteen
million oysters had been removed.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c017'><sup>[161]</sup></a> Owing to scarcity of the
mollusk, no fisheries have existed since 1890, but from 1882 to 1890
they were regularly leased at an average of Rs.5000 for each term
of three years. Prof. James Hornell, who made a careful examination
in 1905, reported that if the business were carried on providently
and systematically, “it should become the source of a fairly
regular annual revenue to Government of from Rs.10,000 to Rs.12,000,
possibly even more.”<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c017'><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>The <i>Placuna</i> oysters are caught by Moormen divers, who are
scarcely equal physically to the pearl fishery in the sea. They rarely
descend more than four fathoms, and most of the work in Tablegram
Bay is in less than two fathoms. Each diver returns with from one to
five or more oysters, depending on their abundance, and receives one
half of the catch as his share of the proceeds. Unlike the method in the
pearl-oyster fishery of Ceylon, the <i>Placuna</i> oysters are opened while
fresh, this work being performed by coolies, who are compensated at
the rate of about Rs.3 per 1000.</p>

<p class='c013'>Notwithstanding the great fame of the pearl fisheries of India,
those prosecuted within the limits of British India proper are of small
extent. The only pearl resources within the empire are the rarely
productive reefs on the Madras coast in the vicinity of Tuticorin, the
relatively modern fisheries of Mergui Archipelago, and some small
reefs of only local importance on the Malabar coast and in the Bombay
presidency.</p>

<p class='c013'>The celebrity of India in connection with the pearl fisheries has never
rested on the extent of those within the territorial limits or under the
control of this government. It originated in the fact that it is largely
Indian capital which finances the fisheries of Ceylon and of the
Persian Gulf; nearly all of the divers and others employed in Ceylon
are from the coast of this empire, and most of the pearls are purchased
by merchants of Bombay, Madura, Trichinopoli, and other
large towns. Thus, from an economic and industrial point of view,
the pearl fisheries of Ceylon, and to a less extent those of the Persian
Gulf, have contributed to the fame and to the wealth of the Empire
of India.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearl fisheries off Tuticorin in the Madras presidency have been
referred to incidentally in the account of the fisheries of Ceylon. They
are separated by only a few miles of water, and are prosecuted by the
same fishermen and in precisely the same manner. Consequently, it
is difficult to discuss them separately, especially in their early history
and during the time that this part of the world was under the rule of
the Portuguese and later of the Dutch.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>The pearling regions in Ceylon and British India</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The fisheries of the Madras coast compete in antiquity with those
of Ceylon. Indeed, from the time of Ptolemy to the seventeenth century,
the industry seems to have been prosecuted largely from the Madras
side of the gulf, centering at Chayl or Coil on the sandy promontory
of Ramnad. This place appears to be the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κόλχοι</span> of Ptolemy,
the Ramana Koil of the natives, as well as the Cael of the travelers
of the Middle Ages. But during the last three hundred years, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Ceylon side has been the scene of the greatest pearling operations; and
from the Madras coast, the fisheries have not been prosecuted except
at long intervals, averaging once in fifteen or twenty years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Owing to the scarcity of oysters and to other causes, the fishery
was prosecuted on the Madras coast in only eight years of the whole
period from 1768 to 1907. These years of productivity were 1822,
1830, 1860, 1861, 1882, 1889, 1890, and 1900; and even then the yield
was relatively small. The largest was 15,874,500 oysters in 1860,
from which the Madras government derived a revenue of Rs.250,276;
and about half as many oysters were obtained in 1861 with a revenue
of Rs.129,003. Numerous and prolonged experiments in conserving
the reefs and in cultivating the oysters have been made without success.
The reason usually given for the greater wealth of oysters on
the Ceylon side is, that it is more sheltered from the strong currents
which sweep down the Bay of Bengal into the Gulf of Manaar and impinge
directly on the coast of the mainland.</p>

<p class='c013'>The headquarters of the fishery are at Tuticorin, near to Madura,
the Benares of the south, the holy “City of Sweetness” which the gods
have delighted to honor from time immemorial. But the camp is commonly
erected of palmyra and bamboo on the barren shore several
miles distant from Tuticorin. The 1890 fishery was at Salápatturai,
and that of 1900 at a place which received the mouth-filling name of
Veerapandianpatanam.</p>

<p class='c013'>The preparations for pearling at Tuticorin are similar to those on
the Ceylon coast. In the autumn the reefs are examined by government
inspectors, and if the conditions seem to warrant a fishery in the
following spring, arrangements are made therefor and the proper
notification issued. The announcement follows the general plan of
that in Ceylon. The following, from the Fort St. George “Gazette,”
Madras, January 16, 1900, is a copy of the notification preceding the
last fishery which has occurred:</p>

<p class='c020'>Notice is hereby given that a pearl fishery will take place at Veerapandianpatanam
on or about the 12th March, 1900.</p>

<p class='c020'>1. The bank to be fished is the Theradipulipudithapar, estimated to employ
100 boats for twenty days with average loads of 7,000 oysters per day.</p>

<p class='c020'>2. It is therefore recommended that such boat owners and divers as may
wish to be employed shall be at Tuticorin on or before the 1st of March next
and anchor their boats abreast of the government flagstaff; the first day’s fishing
will take place on the 12th of March, weather permitting.</p>

<p class='c020'>3. The fishery will be conducted on account of Government, and the oysters
put up for sale in such lots as may be deemed expedient.</p>

<p class='c020'>4. The arrangements of the fishery will be the same as have been usual on
similar occasions.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>On the long sweep of desolate shore at a place convenient to the
reefs, a temporary camp is erected, just as is done on the Ceylon coast.
However, this camp is not nearly so large, only about one fourth or
one fifth the size of that on the eastern side of the gulf. It resembles
the larger one in the quarters for divers and merchants, the bazaars,
the bungalows for the officials, the hospital, the sale and washing inclosures,
etc.; in addition to these is the temporary Roman Catholic
chapel.</p>

<p class='c013'>The divers are mainly of the Parawa caste from Tuticorin, Pinnacoil,
Pamban, etc. on the Madras coast. Although influenced by many
Hindu superstitions, they are nominally Roman Catholics, as evidenced
by the scapulars suspended from the neck, their ancestors having been
converted and baptized through the zealous work of that prince of
missionaries, St. Francis Xavier, in the sixteenth century. Even yet
a chapel at Pinnacoil is held in special reverence by these people as a
place where the saintly father preached. Professor Hornell writes
that the present hereditary head of this caste is Don Gabriel de Croos
Lazarus Motha Vaz, known officially as the Jati Talaiva More, or
Jati Talaivan. He resides at Tuticorin, and is largely the intermediary
between the government and the Parawa fishermen.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the details of its prosecution, the Madras fishery differs in no
important particular from that of Ceylon. The boats are manned and
operated in precisely the same way; they fish in the morning only, taking
advantage of the prevailing favorable winds; the divers carry the
oysters into the government inclosure, and divide them into three equal
lots, of which they receive one; the share of the government is auctioned
daily, the divers disposing of theirs as they choose; and the
oysters are rotted and washed in the same manner as in Ceylon.</p>

<p class='c013'>In addition to the fishery for pearl-oysters at Tuticorin, two other
species of pearl-producing mollusks are collected in the Madras presidency;
one of these is a species of mussel (<i>Mytilus smaragdinus</i>, according
to Dr. Edgar Thurston of the Madras Museum), which is
collected from the estuary of the Sonnapore River near Berhampore;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>and the other is the <i>Placuna placenta</i>, found in many places in this
presidency, and especially in Pulicat Lake and in the vicinity of Tuticorin.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Sonnapore mussels, which are small and bright green in color,
are found adhering to the masses of edible oysters in depths of ten or
twelve feet of water. They are caught in a novel manner, as described
in a letter from the acting collector of customs at Ganjam. Thrusting
a long bamboo pole deep into the bottom of the reef, the fisherman
dives down, and holding on to this bamboo, breaks off as large a mass
of the oysters as he can bring to the surface in one hand, helping himself
up the bamboo pole with the other. Removing the mussels from
the mass, he opens them with a suitable knife and by running his
thumbs and fingers over the flesh tissues, detects the pearls therein.
These pearls are of very inferior quality and of little ornamental
value. They are sold mostly for chunám and for placing in the mouth
of deceased Hindus.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along the west coast of India, in the Bombay presidency, a few
pearls are found at various places, but the output is of slight value.
The most important of these is off the coast of Nawanagar, on the
south side of the Gulf of Cutch, where the true pearl-oyster is found.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to the “Jamnagar Diwan,” the yearly value of the Nawanagar
fisheries is about Rs.4000. This is smaller than formerly, as
the reefs are in a depleted state; to give them a chance to recuperate,
a close season was established in 1905. The oysters are found along a
coast-line eighty miles in length extending from Mangra, near Jodya
Bunder, to Pindera in the Gulf of Cutch, and also about the islands of
Ajad, Chauk, Kalumbar, and Nora, which are also situated in the
Cutch Gulf. They are not procured by diving, but are gathered off
the rocks when the tide is out. During the monsoon, the collection is
limited to eight days in the month; <i>i.e.</i>, from the twelfth to the fifteenth
of each half according to the Hindu calendar.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fisheries are by law restricted exclusively to the <i>waghers</i> of
ten villages, which are Varinar, Sashana, Sika, Balachedi, Jhakher,
Sarmat, Bharana, Salaya, Chudesar, and Bedi. The collection of the
pearls is left entirely to these men, who at Divala—the Hindu new
year—bring all the pearls gathered by them to the durbar. There an
estimate is made of their value, one fourth of which is paid to the
<i>waghers</i>, and the pearls are turned over to the representatives of the
state treasury for sale. This method of conducting the industry has
been long established. In recent years the government experimented
in farming out the revenue, but the old custom has been resumed in
order to placate the native fishermen.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few pearl-oysters are also found on the Ratnagiri coast below
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Bombay, and likewise at Kananur in the Malabar district. In 1901–1902,
there was some local excitement about pearls found at Belapur
and quantities were reported as collected; but since then little has been
heard of the industry in that region.</p>

<p class='c013'>Elsewhere on the west coast of India, pearls are obtained from the
so-called “window-glass” shell, of the genus <i>Placuna</i>. The individual
shells are flat, thin, and transparent, and are still used in Goa and
vicinity as a substitute for glass in windows. This mollusk is abundant
from Karachi, near the Baluchistan border, to the Kanara district
south of Bombay; and wherever it occurs in any abundance it is
collected for the sake of the small pearls found therein.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the fishery at Karachi, Mr. E. H. Aitken writes: “It is farmed
out by Government for a good sum. In 1901, the amount realized
was Rs.3650 for a period of three years; but the lessee lost
heavily, and in 1904 the highest offer for a similar period of three
years was Rs.1851. Pearls may be found in as many as ten to twenty
per cent. of the mature mollusks.” Pearls are far more numerous in
the <i>Placuna</i> than in the pearl-oysters, but few of them are of sufficient
size or luster to be used as ornaments, ranking with the so-called
medicinal pearls of Europe. They are much softer in texture than
the pearls of the Margaritiferæ. The largest are commonly of irregular
form, with the surface slightly botryoidal or like the “strawberry”
pearls of the Mississippi. While not often used as ornaments, they
are highly valued by the Hindus in calcined or powdered form for
medicinal purposes, and especially to be chewed with the betel-nut,
and are also used in the original form in funeral rites, a small quantity
being placed in the mouth of a deceased person.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Mergui Archipelago, which is within the territory of lower
Burma and under the jurisdiction of the government of British India,
patches of pearl-oyster reefs are scattered over an area roughly computed
at 11,000 square miles, taking 97° 40′ as the western boundary.
They occur principally in the strong tidal passages among the islands.
The bottom is formed largely of porphyritic granite interspersed with
sand and thinly covered with corals, coral cups, the long whip-like
black coral (<i>Antipathes arborea</i>), and other submarine animal and
vegetable growths.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c017'><sup>[163]</sup></a> These constitute a home most favorable to the
growth and development of molluscan life.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the several species of pearl-bearing mollusks occurring in the
Mergui Archipelago, by far the most important is the “mok,” or large
Australian pearl-oyster (<i>Margaritifera maxima</i>). The shell attains
a maximum size of about thirteen inches in diameter, and the nacre is
of a milky or silvery color. This species occurs in its two varieties of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“golden lip” and “silver edge,” the former being in greater abundance.
The “silver edge” shell is the more valuable owing to its uniformity
of coloring, and the pearls found therein are of superior luster and
orient.</p>

<p class='c013'>The “pate goung,” or Lingah pearl-oyster (<i>Margaritifera vulgaris</i>),
is similar to that of the Gulf of Manaar. It is circular in shape
and measures about two and one half inches in diameter. The nacre
is silvery, with slight yellowish tinge. Many of the pearls from this
species are of a silvery color, but most of them are yellowish or
golden. The fishery for this mollusk is of little importance compared
with that for the larger pearl-oyster, which is the species referred to
in Mergui when not otherwise mentioned.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearl fisheries of Mergui originated with the Selangs or
Salangs, a nomadic race of maritime gipsies, the last remnants of
whom live among the three thousand islands of this group. They are
supposed to be of Malay descent; but their early history is unknown,
and they are rapidly passing away in the conflict of existence with the
neighboring peoples. Probably in no part of the world are the pearl
fisheries prosecuted by a more primitive class of men. With their
women and children, they live mainly in roomy dug-out boats; but
during the southwest monsoon they erect temporary shelters on the
shore, these consisting of a few frail sticks, supporting coverings of
braided mats, and floors of bamboo strips.</p>

<p class='c013'>They have few wants and derive a livelihood principally from gathering
and bartering shells, pearls, cured <i>thadecon</i>, and nests of the sea-swallow
(Collocalia). Within depths of six or eight fathoms they are
fairly good divers, both the men and the women, but their physical
endurance is slight. Their trade is mostly with Chinese merchants
who visit them in small vessels. No information exists as to when the
Selangs first found profit in searching for pearls; but it was probably
many centuries ago, and for a long time they made contributions of
them to the Buddhist rulers of Burma.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly after the acquisition of Mergui Archipelago in 1826, representatives
of the British government brought experienced divers from
southern India to examine more fully the resources which the Selangs
had made known; but as only seed-pearls were secured, the government
concluded that they would yield an insignificant revenue, and the
attempt to develop these resources was given up.<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c017'><sup>[164]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>However, the Selangs continued to fish in their primitive fashion;
and as the market for the shell developed, the profits increased. But
their wants were easily appeased, and the increased profits were counterbalanced
by decreased activities. Old traders among the islands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>tell of the opportunities of those days when choice pearls could be
obtained for a pinch of opium or for a few ounces of tobacco.</p>

<p class='c013'>Far from the highways of the world, the Selangs remained undisturbed
in their beautiful seas until nearly twenty years ago. Meanwhile,
800 miles distant, Singapore had arisen from a desert shore to
the rank of a great seaport, and the headquarters for the pearl fishery
of the Malay Archipelago and of the northwestern coast of Australia.
In this fishery the vessels were well equipped and depended on the use
of diving apparatus rather than on nude divers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Beginning about 1888, some of these vessels made occasional visits
to the Mergui pearl-oyster reefs, and usually with very profitable results.
This was the first instance in which diving apparatus was successfully
introduced on any part of the Asiatic coast from the Red
Sea to Malacca Strait. So great was the profit that nearly every one
on the lower coast of Burma with sufficient capital or credit hastened
to obtain a boat and diving equipment. The success of some of these
early ventures was remarkable, single pearls worth $3000, $5000, and
even $10,000 each being secured. The reefs in the shoal waters were
rapidly depleted, to the great disadvantage of the nude Selangs, who
can do little in deep water.</p>

<p class='c013'>With a view to deriving a revenue from these well-equipped vessels,
the government of Burma in 1898 divided the 11,000 square miles of
pearling territory into five definite areas known as “blocks.” The
area within each of these blocks was surveyed, marked, and charted;
and the financial commissioner from time to time determined as to each
block whether licenses for pearl fishing should be issued, or whether
the exclusive right therein should be leased. These leases were
disposed of either by inviting tenders and granting the lease to any
of the persons who might tender, or by public auction, as the financial
commissioner might direct. By the terms of the lease, the lessee was
obliged to register at the office of the deputy commissioner of finance
the number of boats and pumps employed by him; to declare by letter,
at the end of each month, the number, weight, and estimated value of
all mother-of-pearl shell and pearls collected during the month, and to
refrain from taking any mother-of-pearl measuring less than six
inches from lip to hinge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Outside the limits of blocks in which the exclusive pearl fishing was
leased, licenses to use diving implements were granted in such number
and on payment of such fees, not exceeding Rs.1000 per apparatus,
as might from time to time be fixed, every such license expiring on
June 30 next following the date on which it was granted, and no license
was transferable.</p>

<p class='c013'>The five blocks in which the Mergui pearling rights were leased are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>of large area, averaging somewhat over 2000 square miles each. The
lessees customarily granted permits to subsidiary fishermen to operate
in their respective blocks, on payment of a royalty, this ranging in
amount from 12½ to 25 per cent. of the mother-of-pearl secured, and
the pearls found were the absolute property of the fishermen.</p>

<p class='c013'>Until 1900 the pearling rights were leased by blocks as above noted.
Rights to catch trochus, green snail shells, and sea-slugs, were included
in the lease. It was noticed that European pearlers always sublet
the trochus and green snail rights, and it was decided to auction
these separately; while as regards pearling proper the auction system
was abolished in that year in favor of a system of licensing individual
vessels for a fee of Rs.400 each. The right to collect pearls by nude
diving was thought for some time to have been left free; but subsequently
it was auctioned along with the rights to collect green snails,
trochus and sea-slugs.</p>

<p class='c013'>The local headquarters of the industry are at Mergui, but most of
the supplies are drawn from Maulmain and Rangoon, or from the
more distant Singapore, where the industry is financed. The season
extends from October to April or May, when the southwest monsoon
begins and puts a stop to the fishery on this exposed coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>The boats used are mostly of Burmese build. They measure from 25
to 35 feet in length, and 7 or 8 feet in width, and have 18 to 24 inches
of draft, with curved or half-moon shaped keels, and with high square
sterns. Owing to the very light draft and the amount of free-board,
they are deficient in weatherly qualities; but are fast sailors before the
wind and are easily rowed from place to place. For this reason they
are especially suited to the industry in Mergui, because during the
pearling season calms and light winds prevail and oars form the principal
motive power, especially in the channels and passageways between
the islands where the tides are frequently very swift.</p>

<p class='c013'>If a number of boats are of the same ownership, a schooner of
thirty to one hundred tons’ capacity is commonly provided as a floating
station and base of supplies for them; the gathering of such a fleet
presents an interesting sight, like a great white hen among her brood
of chickens.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Most of the boats are from Mergui, and are chartered at a monthly
rate of from Rs.105 to Rs.120 each, including a crew of four or five
Burmans with their subsistence, consisting principally of rice and
salted fish; the charterer is further required to pay each member of
the crew four annas, or one rupee, for each day actually employed in
operating the diving pump. In addition to these men, each boat carries
one diver and an attendant, commonly known as “tender.” The
boat is sailed or rowed by the crew, as directed by the diver; and while
the latter is submerged, the boat and crew are under the supervision
of the attendant.</p>

<p class='c013'>The divers are the most important men in the fleet, for on their
ability and efficiency depends the success of the enterprise. A very
considerable portion of them are natives of the Philippine Islands,
although many Japanese have been employed recently, and the number
is increasing. The compensation is at the rate of £2 to £4 per month,
and £20 for each ton of mother-of-pearl secured. The attendants are
likewise mostly Manilamen, but many Malayans and Burmans are
employed; the wages range from Rs.50 to Rs.80 per month, including
provisions. The peculiar duties of the attendant are to help the diver
into his dress, place the shoulder leads into position, screw on the
helmet, and especially to receive and respond to signals and to direct
the movements of the vessel in accordance therewith.</p>

<p class='c013'>The scaphander, or diving dress, is composed of solid sheet rubber,
covered on both sides with canvas. The head-piece is made of tinned
copper, and is fitted with three glasses, one at the front and one on
each side, so as to afford the diver as wide a view as is consistent with
strength of construction. It has a valve by which he can regulate the
pressure of the atmosphere. The dress has a double collar, the inner
portion coming up around the neck, and the other hermetically fastened
to the breastplate. The breastplate is likewise made of copper. The
suit is connected with the air-pump by means of a stout rubber tube
which enters the helmet, and through which air is supplied to the diver
incased therein. This air-tube consists of three or four lengths—each
of fifty feet—of light hose, commonly called “pipe.” This is buoyant
so that it may be easily pulled along, and may not readily foul among
the rocks. However, when working on very rough bottom with
sharp-edged stones, the lower length is of stouter material in order
to resist the chafing on the bottom. Before descending, the air-line
is loosely coiled around the diver’s arm to prevent a sudden strain on
it when it is tightened, and a signal-line is attached to his waist to
enable him to communicate with the men above.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>In fishing, if the current is slight, the boat is permitted to drift
therewith, and if there is little or no current, it is propelled by oars
as may be required. The diver—fully dressed in the rubber suit with
helmet, etc.,—goes overboard easily by means of a Jacob’s ladder of
five or six rungs on the port side of the boat, and is lowered by an
attendant, who gives close attention to the lines, the crew having
manned the pump in the meantime. On reaching bottom, the diver
walks along, following the course of the moving boat and swinging
his shoulders from side to side to take in a wide vision in his search
for oysters. In clear water he can discover them at a distance of
twenty-five or thirty feet, even when fifteen fathoms below the surface;
but sometimes the water is so clouded that it may be necessary
for him to go almost on hands and knees to see them, and when the
seaweeds are thick and high, he may locate them almost as much by
feeling as by sight. Owing to this difficulty in seeing the oysters, the
work is suspended in rough weather and for many days following.
The catch is placed in a sack or basket of quarter inch rope, which is
raised when filled, emptied, and returned to the bottom by means of
a rope.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finding the shell is by no means an easy matter, and much natural
hunter-craft is necessary. Of a neutral color, it is not at all conspicuous
as it lies on a gray coral bed, itself covered with coral or
sponge or hidden in dense masses of gorgeous seaweeds. Still less
visible is the shell on a muddy bottom, for there it embeds itself and
exposes only half an inch or so of the “lip.” As the boat is impelled
by the tide, the diver may have to walk rapidly in a swinging gait;
and if he should stumble or fall while stooping to pick up the shell,
recovery of balance may be difficult. He must be constantly on the
alert and has many dangers to avoid. Sharks are numerous in these
clear tropical waters; but although disaster sometimes results, they are
timid, a stream of air bubbles from the sleeve of the dress sending
them away in fright. More fruitful sources of danger are fouled air-pipes,
broken pumps, falling into holes, and especially paralysis from
recklessly deep diving.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the diver wishes to come up, he closes the escape valve in his
helmet; his dress fills and distends with air, causing a speedy return
to the surface, and the tender hauls him alongside by means of the
life-line. After “blowing” for a few minutes with the helmet removed,
and usually enjoying the indispensable cigarette, he returns
to the bottom.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Mergui reefs were first exploited by diving apparatus,
the bulk of the shells were secured from depths of ten to twelve
fathoms. These shallow reefs have been exhausted, temporarily, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>least, and the divers now work in deeper water, fifteen, twenty, and
even twenty-five fathoms, if the bottom is very uneven and rocky.
Many shells are found in the depressions between the large boulders,
which may be twenty or thirty feet deeper than the surrounding areas.</p>

<p class='c013'>The oysters are opened by means of the long-bladed working-knife
of the country, known as <i>dah-she</i>. The flesh is thrown into a large
basket or washtub, where it is searched by the proprietor of the boat,
who takes each piece between the hands and squeezes and feels through
every part of it. After the flesh has been carefully examined, the
sediment at the bottom of the tub is washed and panned to obtain
those pearls which have fallen through the flesh tissues. The Mergui
pearls are commonly of good color and luster, and compare favorably
with those from the Sulu Archipelago or the Dutch East Indies.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sea-green shell of the snail (<i>Turbo marmoratus</i>) is gathered
in large quantities by the nude diving Selangs, who barter it to Chinese
traders at the equivalent of Rs.8 or 10 per 100 in number. The
flesh is also dried and disposed of to these traders under the name of
<i>thadecon</i>, at about Rs.3 per <i>viss</i> of 3.33 pounds. This mollusk yields
a few greenish yellow pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1895, three pearl reefs were discovered off the Bassein coast in
the district of Irawadi.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c017'><sup>[165]</sup></a> These proved fairly remunerative for one
season and a portion of another, when they were abandoned.</p>

<h3 class='c031'>THE PEARL FISHERIES OF THE RED SEA, GULF OF ADEN, ETC.</h3>

<p class='c035'>Under the Ptolemies, and even long after—under the
Califs—these were islands whose merchants were princes;
but their bustle and glory have since departed from them,
and they are now thinly inhabited by a race of miserable
fishermen.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c036'>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The Red Sea was one of the most ancient sources of pearls, furnishing
these gems for centuries before the Christian era, and particularly
during the reign of the Ptolemies. These pearls were alluded to by
Strabo, Ælianus, and other classical writers. Although the prominence
of the fisheries has suffered by comparison with those of Persia
and Ceylon, the yield has been more or less extensive from the days of
Solomon up to the present time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the several pearl-yielding mollusks in the Red Sea and on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>southeast coast of Arabia, the largest and best known is that called
“sadof” by the Arabs, and which has been identified by Jameson as
<i>Margaritifera m. erythræensis</i>. This is closely related to the large
species in the Persian Gulf. It is commonly four or five inches in
diameter, and in exceptional instances attains a diameter of eight
inches and a weight of three pounds or more. In addition to its
size, it is distinguished by a dark green coloring about the edges, and
a more or less greenish tint over the nacreous interior surface; this
color is darker in the vicinity of Jiddah and Suakin than at the southern
end of the sea, or in the Gulf of Aden. This species occurs singly
rather than congregated in beds or reefs. Although it is found in
depths of fifteen fathoms or more, most of the fishing is in less than
five fathoms of water.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, the pearling center of the world</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The “sadof” yields pearls only rarely, and is sought principally for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>the shells, which afford good qualities of mother-of-pearl, the pearls
furnishing an additional but always looked-for profit to the regular
source of income. As in other regions, there is no constant relation
between the value of the pearls and the quantity of mollusks taken.
The oysters of some reefs are comparatively rich in certain years;
while in other seasons or on other reefs the mollusks may be numerous
but yield very few pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>The second species of importance in the Red Sea is similar to the
Lingah oyster and is known to the Arabs as “bulbul.” This is much
smaller than the “sadof,” averaging less than three inches in diameter.
It is collected for the pearls exclusively, the shells being too small
for industrial use; but only 3 or 4 per cent. of the individuals yield
pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is claimed by writers of authority that it is the red Pinna pearl
from this sea that is referred to in the Scriptures under the name
<i>peninim</i> as the most precious product, and which has been translated as
rubies.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c017'><sup>[166]</sup></a> The shell is extremely fragile, and the nacreous interior is
white tinged with a beautiful red. It is of little importance in the commercial
fisheries of the Red Sea at the present time.</p>

<p class='c013'>The “sadof” is more scattered and less numerous than the “bulbul”;
and in order to save much useless diving, it is customary to inspect
the bottom before descending. Therefore, operations are largely
restricted to calm weather, when the water is sufficiently clear to
enable the divers to sight the individual oysters on the bottom. In
recent years, water-telescopes have been used to assist in locating
them. The most popular form consists of a tin can with a sheet of
glass inserted in the bottom. The glazed end of the tin is submerged
several inches below the surface, affording a far-reaching and much
clearer vision. In this fishery the divers work from small canoes
(<i>uri</i>), each manned by two men, one of whom rows while the other
leans over the bow and searches for the oysters. When one is
sighted, he dives into the water for it, and then returns to the boat
to resume the search.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearling season begins commonly in March or April, and continues
until about the end of May; it is renewed in the autumn, continuing
through September and October.<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c017'><sup>[167]</sup></a> The vessels employed are
of two varieties: <i>dhows</i> carrying from twenty to eighty men each, and
the much smaller <i>sambuks</i> or sail-boats without decks, each with
from six to twenty-five men, most of whom are Negro slaves. Many
of the large vessels are from the Persian Gulf. The <i>sambuks</i> are
owned principally by Zobeid Bedouins inhabiting the coast between
Jiddah and Yambo, and also the islands near the southern end of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>sea, which are very hot-beds of pearls, shells, religious frenzy and
half famished Arabs and Negro slaves.</p>

<p class='c013'>The “bulbul” oysters are taken in nearly the same manner as in the
Persian Gulf. When the vessel is located over the reef, each diver
descends, commonly with a short stick of iron or hard wood, with
which he releases the oysters within reach; placing them in a sack, he
is pulled up by an attendant when his breath is nearly exhausted.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fisheries are prosecuted along both sides of the Red Sea and
in the channels among the islands, from the Gulf of Akabah to Bab-el-Mandeb.
They are especially extensive among the Dahlak Islands
on the coast of the Italian colony Eritrea, where the population is
largely supported by them. This was the center of the industry
during the time of the Ptolemies and in the early Christian era. The
fisheries are also important in the vicinity of Jiddah, the port of
entrance for Mecca and Medina, holiest places of Islam. They likewise
exist near Kosseir at the northern end of the sea, and at Suakin,
Massawa, the Farsan Islands, and Loheia, near the lower end. They
are carried on by Arabs, who succeed in evading efforts at control on
the part of the local governments. Even on the African side, the Arab
fishermen predominate, for the native Egyptian has never evinced
much fondness for venturing on the sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the southeast coast of Arabia, pearl fishermen are to be found
at the various harbors from Aden to Muscat. Their fantastic dhows
are met with in the harbor of Makalla, and also in that of Shehr.
On the Oman coast, the ports of Sur and of sun-scorched Muscat do a
considerable pearling business, not only locally but to the Sokotra
Islands, and even on the coast of East Africa and Zanzibar, the trading
baggalas adding pearling and illicit slave-trading to their many sources
of income. A number of these traders, each with an instinct for
pearls equal to that of a trained hound for game, visit the fishing
centers at intervals, and exchange needful commodities for pearls
and shells.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Arab pearl-divers of the Red Sea have been noted for the depths
to which they can descend. Lieutenant J. R. Wellsted, of the Indian
Navy, who had unusual facilities for acquaintance with their exploits,
reported that in the Persian Gulf the fishermen rarely descended beyond
eleven or twelve fathoms, and even then they exhibited signs of
exhaustion; but that in the Red Sea they go down twice that depth.
Among the most noted of these divers of the last century was old
Serúr, who attracted the notice of many travelers. Lieutenant Wellsted
states that he saw him descend repeatedly to twenty-five fathoms
without the slightest evidence of distress; that he frequently dived in
thirty fathoms, and is reported to have brought up mud from the
bottom at a depth of thirty-five fathoms, which is about the record,
the pressure of the water being nearly 90 pounds to the square
inch. His sons were also remarkably expert; one of them when
scarcely thirteen years of age would descend to a depth of twenty-five
fathoms.<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c017'><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>An interesting story of an Arab’s diving ability is told by Lieutenant
Wellsted: “In 1827, we were cruising in the sloop <i>Ternate</i> on the pearl
banks. Whilst becalmed and drifting slowly along with the current,
several of the officers and men were looking over the side at our Arab
pilot, who had been amusing himself in diving for oysters. After
several attempts, his search proved unsuccessful. ‘Since I cannot get
oysters I will now,’ said he, ‘dive for and catch fish.’ All ridiculed the
idea. He went down again, and great was our astonishment to see
him, after a short time, rise to the surface with a small rock-fish in
each hand. His own explanation of the feat was, that as he seated
himself at the bottom, the fish came around and nibbled at his skin.
Watching his opportunity, he seized and secured his prey by thrusting
his thumb and forefinger into their expanded gills.”<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c017'><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Owing to the character of the fishery and the lack of government
supervision, it is extremely difficult to determine accurately the extent
of this industry in the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf. All over this
coast extends the influence of the Hindu traders, who finance the
fisheries and purchase most of the catch. The pearls are sent mostly
to Bombay, and are not reported in the official returns of the Red Sea
ports. The fishermen are suspicious of outside inquiries, and are far
from anxious to impart reliable information. Probably the best estimates
of the catch are to be obtained from Bombay merchants, from
whom A. Perazzoli learned in 1898 that pearls to the value of 2,000,000
lire ($400,000) were carried from the Red Sea to Bombay each year.<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c017'><sup>[170]</sup></a>
In the last four or five years the output has been smaller than usual,
owing to disturbed political conditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>The annual product of “Egyptian” and “Bombay” shells in these
fisheries is usually upward of 1000 tons, worth from $100 to $600
per ton, according to quality. Most of these go to Austria and
France, only about 200 tons reaching London each year. Owing to
the dark color and the lack of thickness in the nacreous layer, they
are scarcely suitable for anything else than button manufacture.
Many of them are sent to Bethlehem and Jerusalem, where they are
cut into various shapes for crosses, crucifixes, wafer-boxes, beads,
and nearly every conceivable article in which mother-of-pearl is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>manufactured. Many of the choicest shells are incised with scriptural
or allegorical designs for sale to tourists as well as for export. The
best of the engraved shells sell for $10 to $50, and the cheaper ones
for less than $1 each. This industry is of great importance in Bethlehem,
giving employment to a considerable percentage of the eight
thousand inhabitants of the village.</p>

<p class='c013'>Doubtless in no pearl fishery in the world are greater hardships
endured than in the Red Sea and along the coast of the Arabian Gulf.
In practically every other region, the industry is carried on under
government supervision, and there is little opportunity for ill-treatment
of the humbler fishermen. But the fanatics who control the
fishery on the Arabian coast—untrammeled by authorities and responsible
to none—show little consideration for the poor divers, and
particularly for the unfortunate black slaves brought from the coast
of Africa.</p>

<p class='c013'>These pearl fishermen lead a very eventful life, the divers especially.
They see some wonderful sights down below the surface-plant life
and creeping things and enemies innumerable. Dropping from the
sun-scorched surface down into the deep cool waters, everything shows
“a sea change, into something rich and strange,” just as the eyes of
the drowned man in Ariel’s song are turned into pearls and his bones
into coral.</p>

<p class='c013'>And there are enemies innumerable. The terrible sharks, prowling
about near the bottom, prove a source of perpetual uneasiness, and in
the aggregate many fishermen are eaten by these bloodthirsty tigers
of the sea. There are horrible conflicts with devil-fish equaling that
in Hugo’s “Toilers of the Sea.” The saw-fish is also a source of
danger, particularly in the Arabian Gulf, and instances are reported
in which divers have been cut in two by these animals, which sometimes
attain a length of twelve or fifteen feet, and possess a saw five
feet long and three inches broad, armed on each edge with teeth two
inches in length. Another menacing peril is the giant clam (<i>Tridacna
gigas</i>), a monster bivalve, whose shell measures two or three feet
in diameter, and is firmly anchored to the bottom. This mollusk
occurs on many of the Asiatic pearling grounds. Lying with the
scalloped edges a foot or more apart, a foot or a hand of the diver
may be accidentally inserted. When such a fate befalls a fisherman,
the only escape is for him to amputate the member immediately. Once
in a while on the pearling shores a native may be found who has been
maimed in this manner, but usually the unfortunate man does not
escape with his life.</p>

<p class='c013'>It appears from ancient Chinese literature, noted in the first
chapter of this book, that pearl fisheries have existed in the rivers
of China for several thousand years. The Chinese also derived
pearls from the sea, and especially from the coast of the province
of Che-kiang. Little is known of the early fisheries, but the fragmentary
literature contains so many allusions to pearls as to lead us
to believe that they were of considerable extent and importance.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is related that about 200 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, a pearl dealer at Shao-hing, an
ancient city between Hang-chau and Ning-po, on the shore of Hang-chau
Bay, furnished to the empress a pearl one inch in diameter, for
which he received five hundred pieces of silver; and to an envious
princess the same dealer sold a “four-inch pearl.” A hundred years
later, the reigning emperor sent an agent to the coast to purchase
“moon pearls,” the largest of which were two thirds of an inch in
diameter.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the tenth century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, Mingti, one of the most extravagant of
the early monarchs, used so many pearls—not only in his personal
decoration but on his equipage and retinue,—that after a formal procession
the way would be rich in the jewels which dropped from the
gorgeous cortège. About 1000 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, an embassy to the emperor
brought as tribute an ornament composed of strings of pearls, and
also 105 liang (8¾ lbs.) of the same gems unmounted.</p>

<p class='c013'>An interesting story is told of “pearl-scattering” by an embassy
to the Chinese court from a Malayan state about 1060. Following
the customs of their country, the ambassadors knelt at the threshold
of the audience chamber, and then advanced toward the throne, bearing
a golden goblet filled with choice pearls and water-lilies wrought
of gold. These they scattered upon the floor at the feet of the
emperor; and the courtiers, hastening to pick them up, secured ten
hang (15 oz.) of pearls.<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c017'><sup>[171]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The Keh Chi King Yuen, a Chinese encyclopedia, describes a pearl
fishery in the southern part of Kwang-tung province, in the department
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>of Lien-chau and near the city of Hóhpú. Fishing began in the
spring, and was preceded by conciliating the gods through certain
sacrifices, in order that the weather might be propitious and that no
disaster might be suffered through sharks and other agencies. The
five sacrificial animals,—horses, cattle, sheep, swine, and fowls,—were
presented; but ordinarily paper images of these were economically
substituted, as equally acceptable to the Chinese rulers of destiny.
In the details of the diving, the fishery resembled somewhat that prosecuted
about the same period in the Gulf of Manaar. The diver was
let down by a rope, and after collecting the mollusks and placing them
in a basket, he was drawn up at a given signal. Much complaint was
made that the divers would open the mollusks, extract the pearls and
conceal them in the mouth before returning to the surface.</p>

<p class='c013'>The business became so perilous and the loss so great, that about
the beginning of the sixteenth century, according to the same encyclopedia,
dredges were adopted. These at first were simple rakes; later
large dredges were trailed along between two boats, by means of
which great quantities of shells were gathered. So important was the
industry that an officer was designated by the viceroy of Canton to
collect a revenue therefrom. It does not appear that pearls have been
collected in considerable numbers on this part of the Chinese coast for
very many years, probably not since the advent of Europeans.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls are yet found in the river mussels in all parts of eastern
Asia, from Siberia to the Indian Ocean, and from the Himalayas to
the Pacific. It is represented that they are not from the <i>Unio margaritifera</i>,
the common river-mussel of Europe, but from other species,
such as <i>Unio mongolicus</i>, <i>U. dahuricus</i>, <i>Dipsas plicatus</i>, etc. It is
quite impossible to obtain a reliable estimate of the total number of
persons employed, or the output of pearls in China, but these items are
certainly very much larger than the average Occidental believes.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the vicinity of Canton the <i>Dipsas plicatus</i> has been used for centuries
by the Chinese in the production of artificial pearls, this industry
giving employment to thousands of persons.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c017'><sup>[172]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The pearl-mussel fishery is of importance in Manchuria, where it
has been carried on for hundreds of years, not only by the citizens, but
by the military department on account of the government, and especially
in the streams which flow into the Songari, a tributary of the
Amur. Jacinth relates that in case of a deficit, the officers and subalterns
were punished by a deduction from their pay, and also by corporal
chastisement.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c017'><sup>[173]</sup></a> Witsen speaks of the pearls from the River Gan,
a tributary of the Amur, and also from the islands of the Amur, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>boundary river of Manchuria. Pearl fisheries were established at
these places by the Russians nearly two centuries ago.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c017'><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls become finer and more plentiful the further we penetrate
into Manchuria; and they are numerous in the lake of Heikow or
Hing-chou-men, “Black Lake” or “Gate of Precious Gems,” where
they have long been exploited for the account of the emperor of China.</p>

<p class='c013'>The occurrence of pearls in many parts of Asiatic Russia was noted
by Von Hessling. In northern Siberia, according to Witsen, writing in
1705,<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c017'><sup>[175]</sup></a> pearls were found in the waters about the town of Mangasea
on the Turuchan; and Von Middendorf notes that they were found in
the Tunguska River, which flows into the Yenisei. Whether, however,
they come from the <i>Unio margaritifera</i> is considered doubtful by Von
Middendorf. Witsen referred to their occurrence in the rivers and
streams of Irkutsk and Onon, and this is confirmed by several writers
of more recent times. Pallas says that the mussels found there are
quite large, and speaks of the Ilim, which flows into the Angara, as
another river where they occur.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ancient books relating to Japan repeatedly allude to the occurrence
of pearls on the coasts of that country. They are mentioned in
the Nihonki, of the eighth century, the oldest Japanese history.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tavernier wrote about 1670: “It is possible that of those who have
written before me concerning pearls, none have recorded that some
years back a fishery was discovered in a certain part of the coasts of
Japan, and I have seen some of the pearls which the Dutch brought
from thence. They were of very beautiful water, and some of them
of large size, but all baroques. The Japanese do not esteem pearls.
If they cared about them it is possible that by their means some banks
might be discovered where finer ones would be obtained.”<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c017'><sup>[176]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In 1727, Kaempfer wrote that pearls, called by the Japanese <i>kainotamma</i>
or shell jewels, were found in oysters and other mollusks almost
everywhere about Saikokf. Every person was at liberty to fish
for them. Formerly the natives had little or no value for them, till
they learned of their estimation by the Chinese, who were ready to pay
good prices for them, their women being very proud of wearing necklaces
and other ornaments of pearls. “The largest and finest pearls
are found in the small sort of oysters, called <i>akoja</i>, which is not unlike
the Persian pearl-oyster. These are found only in the seas about
Satzuma and in the Gulf of Omura (Kiusiu). Some of the pearls
weigh from four to five candareens<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c017'><sup>[177]</sup></a> and these are sold for a hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>kobans each.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c017'><sup>[178]</sup></a> The inhabitants of the Loochoo Islands buy most of
those about Satzuma, since they trade to that province. Those found
on the Gulf of Omura are sold chiefly to the Chinese and Tunquinese,
and it is computed that they buy for about 3000 taels<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c017'><sup>[179]</sup></a> a year.
This great profit occasioned the strict orders, which were made not
long ago by the princes both of Satzuma and Omura, that for the
future there should be no more of these oysters sold in the market
with other oysters, as had been done formerly.”<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c017'><sup>[180]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Kaempfer also noted that the Japanese obtained pearls from the
yellow snail shell and from the <i>taira gai</i> (Placuna) in the Gulf of
Arima, and especially from the awabi or abalone (Haliotis). This mollusk
was much sought after for food, being taken in large quantities by
the fishermen’s wives, “they being the best divers of the country.”<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c017'><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Of the several species of pearl-oysters which occur in the coastal
waters of Japan, the only one of importance at present is the <i>Margaritifera
martensi</i>. While this occurs in very many localities, it is most
numerous among the southern islands, where some fine pearls have
been secured. The fishery for this species was quite extensive thirty or
forty years ago, and the reefs were largely depleted. For nearly a
score of years it has been used in growing culture pearls, an account
of which is given on pages 292, 293.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few pearls are obtained from several other bivalve mollusks in
Japan. Among the collections of the present writers are pearls from
<i>Margaritifera martensi</i>, collected at Bay Agu; from <i>M. panasisæ</i>,
about the Liu-kiu Islands; from <i>Pecten yezocusis</i>, in Sokhaido; from
<i>Mytilus crasitesta</i>, in the Inland Sea, and from North Japan, and from
a species of Dipsas found in Lake Biwa.</p>

<p class='c013'>While the pearl fisheries of Japan are not of great importance in
any single locality, the distribution of the reefs is so extensive that the
aggregate yield is considerable.</p>

<p class='c013'>The awabi or ear-shell (<i>Haliotis gigantea</i>), found on the coast of
Japan, Korea, etc., yields many pearly forms. This species is much
smaller than the California abalones. It has a fairly smooth, nacreous
surface, but its value is depreciated by the great size of the marginal
perforations, which render useless for commercial purposes all
of the shell external to the line of perforations. While its opalescent
tints make it desirable for manufacturing into certain styles of buttons
and buckles, its principal use is for inlaying work or marquetry,
for which it is especially adapted, owing to its fineness of texture and
beauty of coloring even when reduced to thin sheets.</p>

<p>FISHING FOR THE AWABI (ABALONE) SHELLS AT WADA-NO-HARA, JAPAN</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Probably the most interesting of the abalone fisheries is that on
the shores of Quelpaerd Island, about sixty miles south of the Korean
coast, which is prosecuted largely by the women. Dressed only in a
scanty garment, these women swim out to the fishing grounds, distant
several hundred yards in some cases, carrying with them a stout knife
and a small sack suspended from a gourd. On reaching the reefs,
they dive to the bottom—sometimes to a depth of six or eight fathoms—and
by means of the knife, remove the abalones from the bottom
and place them in the sack. They may remain out an hour, diving repeatedly
until the sack is filled, when they swim back to the shore.
Pearls are found only rarely; in one lot of one hundred shells, only
five were found bearing pearls; two with three pearls each, two with
two pearls each, and one with a single pearl. The flesh of this mollusk
after it has been cleaned and dried, is quite popular as an article of
diet. Although white when fresh, the color changes to a dark red.
The pieces of dried flesh, in the form of flat reddish disks four or five
inches in diameter, are fastened on slender sticks—about ten to each
stick—and displayed in the grocery shops in Seul and other cities.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Gulf of Siam on the Asiatic coast, pearls are obtained from
a small oyster with a thin shell, presumably a variety of the Lingah
oyster. The beds have not yet been thoroughly exploited, as the
Siamese do not especially value pearls, attributing some superstitious
sentiments of ill luck to them. However, from time to time Chinese
traders have bought them from the Malay divers and sold them at
great profit in the Singapore market. The known beds occur chiefly
in the northern part of the gulf, on the west coast, and extend in a
narrow belt for a distance of about one hundred miles. The fishing
is prosecuted by nude divers in shallow water. A recent letter from
Dr. K. Van Dort, a mining engineer of Bangkok, Siam, states that in
1906 in six weeks, with the aid of half a dozen divers he was able to
collect 720 grains’ weight of pearls, mostly small ones, but including
one of 20 grains, one of 14 grains, two of 12 grains each, and seven
over 9 grains in weight. He reports that the total value of the large
ones in Bangkok was $1500, but the small ones could not be sold to
any advantage, as they are little prized by the Siamese. The shells
are of no commercial value, as they are too thin for industrial use
other than for inlaid work. Some fine old specimens of marquetry in
which these shells were used exist in the Buddhist temples at Bangkok.
This art of inlaying is almost lost among the Siamese, and there is said
to be only one man in the king’s palace who can lay any claims to
proficiency in working mother-of-pearl shell.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>The principal pearl fisheries of the coasts of Africa are those
prosecuted in the Red Sea, between this continent and Asia.
These have already been described in the preceding chapter,
among the Asiatic fisheries; for, although situated between
the two continents, they are prosecuted largely by Arabs rather than
by natives of the western shores of the sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other than those in the Red Sea, the only pearl resources in Africa
which have received attention are on the eastern coast, south of the
Gulf of Aden. Little information exists as to the origin of these fisheries.
In a paper published by the Lisbon Geographical Society,
January, 1903, Señor Ivens Ferranz states that, according to tradition,
in remote times the Ibo Archipelago, on the northeast coast of
Portuguese East Africa, was inhabited by a Semitic colony, which
located there to fish for pearls, and these were carried through the
Red Sea to King Solomon. He adds that there is little doubt that,
after the great emigration which started from the Persian Gulf in 982
and founded Zanzibar, Kilwa, and Sofala on this coast, some Arabs
engaged in fishing for pearls about the islands near Sofala.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1609 Joao dos Santos wrote that on the sandy sea bottom about
the Bazaruto Islands, which are about 150 miles south of Sofala, there
were many large oysters which bore pearls, and the natives fished for
them by diving in practically the same manner as in the Persian Gulf.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c017'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In a personal memorandum, Sir Robert Edgcumbe states that in the
very early times of Portuguese exploitation on the eastern coast of
Africa, pearl fishing was carried on in these waters. For a long period
the tenure of power exerted by the Portuguese was of a feeble
character; they practically occupied no position of importance on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>mainland, but seized upon stations on the islands which offered decent
harbors. Thus their chief settlements, such as Mozambique and Ibo,
were on islands lying off the coast, and until recent years they made
no serious attempt to occupy the mainland.</p>

<p class='c013'>Arabs and Banyans carried on the commercial traffic of the country,
as they still do, and they were more truly the masters of this coast than
were the Portuguese, who were little more than nominal rulers. Trading
to and from India in their small dhows, the Arabs and Banyans
had full knowledge of the value of pearls, and undoubtedly secured all
that were obtainable. But they observed no restrictions, and without
doubt—for a time, at any rate—greatly impaired the productive power
of the fisheries.</p>

<p class='c013'>The principal pearl reefs of East Africa, so far as known at present,
extend along the coast of the German East African territory from the
Province of Uzaramo to the Rovuma River, the southern limit of that
territory, and also into Portuguese East Africa as far south as Pemba
Bay, a total distance of about 300 miles. Along much of this coast,
there are islands lying from one to two miles off shore, and between
these islands are barriers of reefs, which create a series of lagoons.
In these lagoons, protected by the islands and the reefs from the influence
of the surf formed by the Indian monsoons, there are large
patches of coral rock and groups of living coral, which form excellent
attachments for the pearl-oysters.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is only recently that serious attention has been paid to these pearl
resources, although year by year a considerable number of pearls have
been collected by the natives and sold to Arabs and Banyans, who have
sent them chiefly to India by way of Zanzibar. The natives of these
parts are not very expert in diving, and they collect the oysters principally
by wading out as far as they can at low tide. They do not wait
for the mollusks to attain a proper age, and as a result they find few
pearls of large size. Many parcels of pearls fished in this very elementary
way pass through the custom-house, where they are subject to a
small duty for export, and others are smuggled out of the country.
Quantities of seed-pearls are sent to India, where they are used principally
as a medicine and in cosmetics; and occasionally there are rumors
that some choice pearls have been discovered.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the German territory a concession of the fisheries was granted a
few years ago to Dr. Aurel Schulz; and, although we are not in position
to say what success he has met with, it is reported that he has
secured a considerable number of pearls under four grains in weight,
of fair shape and quality and of good marketable value.</p>

<p class='c013'>A concession of the pearl fishery on the Portuguese coast north of
Ibo has been granted to the East African Pearl Company. For this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>company an examination of the resources is now being made by Mr.
James J. Simpson, acting under direction of Prof. W. A. Herdman, of
the Liverpool University, the technical advisor of the Ceylon Company
of Pearl Fishers.</p>

<p class='c013'>At least four species of pearl-bearing mollusks exist here; these are
<i>Margaritifera vulgaris</i>, <i>M. margaritifera</i>, <i>Pinna nobilis</i>, and a species
of Perna, named in the order of their importance. A preliminary report
of Mr. Simpson (supplied through the courtesy of Sir Robert
Edgcumbe), states that among the Ibo Islands about one half of the
bottom is sandy and the other half is covered with detached pieces of
coral rock, groups of living corals, masses of nullipore, and expanses
of fixed seaweed. On all of these in the shoal waters, there is such an
abundance of pearl-oysters (<i>M. vulgaris</i>) that a single diver, by
simply descending and bringing up a few in his hands each time, can
secure about 200 in fifteen minutes. Oysters also occur singly on the
sandy bottom, but not so abundantly. Within the three-year-old
oysters there are many seed-pearls. It is evident that there has been
an extensive removal of large oysters in recent years and that large
pearls were then found; but the depredations of the natives now prevent
the mollusks from attaining an age and size which render them
useful as pearl-bearers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Said Mr. Simpson in his report: “The women here play great havoc
on the reefs by going out daily and collecting the pearl-oysters at low
tide. All along the coast from Muliga Point to Arimba the shores are
covered with shells. At one place we came across a heap of freshly-opened
oysters which consisted of thirty or forty thousand at the lowest
estimate; while an older heap contained between forty to sixty
millions. Four women who were fishing on the reefs while we were
there had over two thousand oysters in their baskets. Thus it is evident
that immense quantities are annually destroyed. And the worst feature
is that out of those destroyed, not one per cent. were over two years old.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It is the intention of the East African Pearl Company, as soon as the
investigation of the resources is completed, to police the fishing grounds
so as to put an end to the removal of immature oysters, which yield
only seed-pearls, and to permit them to attain maturity. In addition to
this, it is their purpose to utilize the extensive beds of oysters lying in
comparatively deep water, which are now inaccessible to the natives
owing to their lack of diving skill.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Robert Edgcumbe writes that it is impossible to say more at present
than that these fisheries at one time bore a high repute, and that
the oysters have continued to exist in multitudes though fished by the
natives in the immature state; and there is every indication that if
properly policed and worked in a scientific way these fisheries should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>once again become of much importance. The fact that the pearl-bearing
oysters are found there in large quantities, notwithstanding that
they have been poached without restriction by the natives, indicates
that only proper management and policing are necessary to make them
valuable and productive.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the lower coast of Portuguese East Africa, pearl fishing has been
of some local importance. The reefs are most extensive about the
Bazaruto Islands, previously referred to as about 150 miles south of
Sofala. In 1888, when famine prevailed on this coast, the inhabitants
of this archipelago, of both sexes and of all ages, fished for the large
pearl-oysters (known locally as <i>mapalo</i>), selling their catch at Chiloane
to Asiatic traders, who gave them a handful of rice for a large
basket of the mollusks. It was estimated that during two months of
that year, pearls to the value of eighty <i>contos</i> ($83,500) were taken.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c017'><sup>[183]</sup></a>
In 1889 three British subjects attempted to renew the fishery by using
dredges, but without success, owing, it is said, to the great weight of
the implements.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Kafirs of Bazaruto continue to fish irregularly, but their catch
is not of importance. These pearls are carried by traders to Zanzibar,
Muscat, and Bombay. The American consul writes that some years
ago the Portuguese government granted a concession to a company of
American fishermen to exploit the Bazaruto reefs, but the attempt to
work the concession failed through “bad management, lack of funds,
heavy expenses, and political difficulties,” a combination apparently
sufficient to wreck a similar attempt in the most favorable locality.</p>

<p class='c013'>The American consul at Tamatave states that in 1907 the government
of Madagascar awarded two grants for pearl fisheries, covering
the entire western coast, a distance of one thousand miles, excepting
two hundred miles, for which two grants were given in 1906. Apparently
no effort was made to develop the earlier grants; the later ones
may be operated, perhaps jointly. These concessions are personal, and
may not be sold or transferred without the governor-general’s consent.
The use of divers, machinery, dredges, and other apparatus, and the
building of necessary stations are allowed, if there be no interference
with navigation, fishing, or coast travel. An annual tax is to be paid,
with a stated increase each year, and revised according to the success
of the enterprise. A report must be sent yearly to the governor-general.
The grants may be revoked if work is not begun within a stated
period; if the work is needlessly abandoned during one year, or if the
tax is not paid. Whenever the interests of the colony or of the public
service require it, the privilege may be withdrawn without indemnity.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>The occurrence of pearls in the British Isles was known two
thousand years ago, and frequent references to them were
made in Roman writings of the first and second centuries
of the Christian era.</p>

<p class='c013'>In his “Lives of the Cæsars,” the biographer Suetonius, after speaking
of the admiration which Julius Cæsar had for pearls, states that
their occurrence in Britain was an important factor in inducing the
first Roman invasion of that country in 55 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c017'><sup>[184]</sup></a> If this be true, the
English-speaking people owe a vast debt of gratitude to these pearls
in bringing their Briton ancestors in contact with Roman civilization;
and the influence which they have thus exercised on the world’s history
has been greater than that of the pearls from all other regions or,
we might add, than all other jewels.</p>

<p class='c013'>The naturalist Pliny (23–79) stated: “In Brittaine it is certain
that some do grow; but they bee small, dim of colour, and nothing
orient. For Julius Cæsar (late Emperor of famous memorie) doth
not dissimble, that the cuirace or breastplate which he dedicated to
Venus mother within her temple was made of English pearles.”<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c017'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>This decoration of pearls was a very proper offering to the goddess
who arose from the sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>The historian Tacitus noted in “Vita Agricolæ” that the pearls
from Britain were dusky or brownish (<i>subfusca ac liventia</i>).<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c017'><sup>[186]</sup></a>
In his commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew, Origen (185–253),
one of the Greek fathers of the church, described the British pearls as
next in value to the Indian. Their surface, he stated, was of a golden
color, but they were cloudy and less transparent than those from
India.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>We have no certain information whether the pearls secured by the
Romans were from the edible mussel (<i>Mytilus edulis</i>) of the sea-coast
or from the Unios of the fresh-water streams. Tacitus’s statement
that they were collected “as the sea throws them up,” seems to locate
them on the sea-coast; but conditions in modern times make it appear
more probable that they were from the fresh waters.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of the very early coins of the country indicate that pearls were
used to ornament the imperial diadem of the sovereigns of ancient
Britain. In “Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum,” the celebrated
English monk, Bede (673–735) surnamed “The Venerable,” enumerated
among other things for which Britain was famous in his day,
“many sorts of shell-fish, among which are mussels, in which are often
found excellent pearls of all colours; red, purple, violet and green,
but mostly white.”<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c017'><sup>[187]</sup></a> And Marbodus, Bishop of Rennes, in his lapidarium,
written about 1070, refers to the British pearls as equaling
those of Persia and India. About 1094 a present of an Irish pearl
was made to Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, by Gilbert, Bishop
of Limerick.<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c017'><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In the twelfth century there was a market for Scotch pearls in
Europe, but they were less valued than those from the Orient.<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c017'><sup>[189]</sup></a> An
ordinance of John II, King of France, in August, 1355, which confirmed

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>The British and Irish Pearls are found in a large black Muscle....
They are peculiar to rapid and stony rivers; and are common in Wales, and in
the North of England, and in Scotland, and some parts of Ireland. In this
country they are called by the vulgar <i>Kregin Diliw</i>, i.e. Deluge shells; as if
Nature had not intended the shells for the rivers; but being brought thither by
the Universal Deluge, they had continued there, and so propagated their kind
ever since. Those who fish here for Pearls, know partly by the outside of these
Muscles, whether they contain any; for generally such as have them are a little
contracted or distorted from their usual shape. A curious and accomplished
Gentleman, lately of these parts, showed me a valuable Collection of the Pearls
of the Conway River in Wales; amongst which I noted a stool-pearl [button-pearl],
weighing seventeen grains, and distinguished on the convex side with
a fair round spot of a Cornelian colour, exactly in the center.<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c017'><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In 1560 “large handsome pearls” were sent from Scotland to Antwerp.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c017'><sup>[192]</sup></a>
In 1620 a great pearl was found in the Kellie Burn, in Aberdeenshire.
This was carried to King James by the provost, who was
rewarded with “twelve to fourdeen chalder of victuals about Dunfermline,
and the Customs of Merchants’ goods in Aberdeen during
his life.” No record appears of the reward paid to the finder; possibly
it was not worth recording.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1621 the Privy Council of Scotland issued a proclamation that
pearls found within the realm belonged to the Crown; and conservators
of the pearl fisheries were appointed in several of the counties,
including Aberdeen, Ross, and Sutherland. It was the duty of the
conservators, among other things, to nominate experts to fish for
pearls during July and August, “when they are at chief perfection.”
The conservators and fishermen were compensated by selling those
pearls of ordinary quality, but “the best for bignesse and colour” were
to be remitted to the king. It was reported to the Privy Council that
the conservator in Aberdeenshire did very well in the first year. “He
hath not only taken divers pearls of good value, but hath found some
in waters where none were expected.” The first parliament of
Charles I abolished these privileges.</p>

<p class='c013'>Robert Sibbald, physician to Charles II, wrote that he had seen a
necklace of Scotch pearls which was valued at two thousand crowns;
they were “larger than peas, perfectly round, and of a brilliant whiteness.”<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c017'><sup>[193]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>It is said that Sir Richard Wynne of Gwydir presented to Catherine
of Braganza, queen of Charles II of England, a pearl from the Conway
in Wales, which is said to be even yet retained in the royal crown.

<p class='c013'>The White Cart River in Scotland, on which the city of Paisley is
situated, was distinguished, according to Camden, “for the largeness
and the fineness of the Pearls that are frequently found hereabouts
and three miles above.”<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c017'><sup>[194]</sup></a> And the pearls from Irton in Cumberland,
England, were so noted at that time that “fair as Irton pearls” became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>a byword in the north country. In their history of Westmoreland and
Cumberland,<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c017'><sup>[195]</sup></a> Nicolson and Burn state that “Mr. Thomas Patrickson,
late of How of this county (Cumberland), having employed divers
poor inhabitants to gather these pearls, obtained such a quantity as he
sold to the jewellers in London for above £800.” But in 1794 Hutchinson<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c017'><sup>[196]</sup></a>
stated that none had been seen for many years past.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearl fishing in Ireland was of some consequence in the seventeenth
century. Speaking of the Slaney River, Solomon Richards, in a description
of Wexford about the year 1656, said: “It ought to precede
all the rivers in Ireland for its pearle fishing, which though not abundant
are yet excellent, for muscles are daily taken out of it about
fowre, five and six inches long, in which are often found pearles, for
lustre, magnitude and rotundity not inferior to oriental or any other
in the world.”<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c017'><sup>[197]</sup></a> In 1693 Sir Robert Redding wrote that there were four
rivers in the county of Tyrone in northern Ireland which abounded in
pearl-mussels, all four emptying into Lough Foyle and thence into the
sea. They were also to be found in several rivers in the adjacent
Donegal County. Redding gave an interesting description of the
fishery:</p>

<p class='c020'>In the warm months before harvest is ripe, whilst the rivers are low and
clear, the poor people go into the water and take them up, some with their toes,
some with wooden tongs, and some by putting a sharpened stick into the opening
of the shell; and although by common estimate not above one shell in a
hundred may have a pearl, and of these pearls not above one in a hundred be
tolerably clear, yet a vast number of fair merchantable pearls, and too good
for the apothecary, are offered to sale by those people every summer assize.
Some gentlemen of the country make good advantage thereof, and I myself,
whilst there, saw a pearl bought for £2, 10s. that weighed 36 carats, and was
valued at £40, and had it been as clear as some others produced therewith it
would certainly have been very valuable. Everybody abounds with stories of
the good pennyworths of the country, but I will add but one more. A miller
took a pearl, which he sold for £4, 10s. to a man that sold it for £10 to another,
who sold it to the late Lady Glenanly for £30, with whom I saw it in a
necklace; she refused £80 for it from the late Duchess of Ormond.</p>

<p class='c020'>The young muscles never have any pearl in them. The shells that have the
best pearls are wrinkled, twisted, or bunched, and not smooth and equal, as
those that have none. And the crafty fellows will guess so well by the shell,
that though you watch them never so carefully, they will open such shells under
the water, and put the pearls in their mouths, or otherwise conceal them.
Yet sometimes when they have been taking up shells, and believing by such
signs as I have mentioned, that they were sure of good purchase, and refused
good sums for their shares, they found no pearl at all in them. Upon discourse
with an old man that had been long at this trade, he advised me to seek not only
when the waters were low, but on a dusky, gloomy day also, lest, said he, the
fish see you, for then he will shed his pearl in the sand; of which I believe no
more than that some muscles have voided their pearls, and such are often
found in the sands.<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c017'><sup>[198]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>For several years following 1760, the Scotch pearl fisheries were of
considerable local value. The zoölogist, Thomas Pennant, wrote of
them several times in his “Tour of Scotland.” Referring to the
Tay and Isla rivers, then as now the center of the Scotch pearling, he
states: “There has been in these parts a very great fishery of pearl,
got out of the fresh-water muscles. From the year 1761 to 1764,
£10,000 worth were sent to London, and sold from 10s. to £1 6s. per
ounce. I was told that a pearl had been taken there that weighed 33
grains. But this fishery is at present exhausted, from the avarice of
the undertakers. It once extended as far as Loch Tay.”<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c017'><sup>[199]</sup></a> And he
adds later that, some years preceding, a pearl fishery was prosecuted
in Loch Dochart with great success and the pearls were esteemed the
fairest and largest of any.</p>

<p class='c013'>From 1770 to 1860 the pearl resources of Scotland remained almost
dormant, and Scotch pearls were rarely met with in the markets. In
1861 a German merchant, who was acquainted with the beauty of
these gems, traveled through the districts of Tay, Doon and Don,
obtaining a great number which the poor people kept for their own
pleasure, not esteeming them of any market value, and interested the
fishermen in searching for the mussels. The seemingly high prices
which he paid and the abundance of the pearls sent hundreds of persons
to the rivers and small brooks. Those who were otherwise employed
during the day devoted hours of the long summer nights to
diligent search after the coveted shells; while boys and old persons,
who were without regular avocations, waded day after day where
there was a probability of reward. In the course of a short time
pearls, good, bad and indifferent, reached the originator of the movement
at Edinburgh, from Ayrshire, from Perthshire, and from the
Highland regions far beyond the Grampians. He was soon the possessor
of a collection which, for richness and variety, had seldom been
surpassed. A trade in these gems was developed, the patronage of
royalty was obtained, and once more Scotch pearls became fashionable,
and their vogue was enhanced by the fondness which Queen Victoria
entertained for them.</p>

<p class='c013'>In addition to the rivers named, pearls were found in the Forth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the Teith, the Ythan, and the Spey in eastern Scotland. The summer
of 1862 was most favorable for pearling, owing to the dryness of
the season and the low water, and unusually large quantities of
pearls were found, the prices ranging ordinarily from 10s. to £2 6s.
Queen Victoria is said to have purchased one for forty guineas;
others were bought by Empress Eugénie and by the Duchess of Hamilton.
A necklace of them was sold for £350 in 1863.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c017'><sup>[200]</sup></a> The value of
the entire catch in Scotland in 1864 was estimated at £12,000 to the
fishermen, the yield being unusually large in that season owing to the
unprecedented drought which permitted access to the deep beds of the
rivers. In some of the streams the resources were quickly depleted,
but in others the fisheries yielded profitable returns for many years.
While most of the pearls were small, some of them were choice and
of considerable individual value, ranging from £5 to £150, and £500
is said to have been paid for one fine specimen.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearl-mussel of the British Isles (<i>Unio margaritifera</i>) has a
thick, coarse and unsightly shell, from 3 to 7 inches in width and 1½
to 2½ inches in length from the umbo to the lip. The rough exterior
is dark brown, and it is sometimes twisted, distorted and barnacled.</p>

<p class='c013'>It generally lies scattered and detached over the pebbly bottoms,
but it also exists in reefs or beds which are sometimes of considerable
extent. These occur usually where a stretch of water is still and
deep, and oftentimes where the depth places the mussels beyond the
reach of the fishermen. Apart from the pearls it contains, the mussel
is of no economic value except that in some localities the mollusk is
used for bait in cod-fishing.</p>

<p class='c013'>In recent years the pearl-mussel has been numerous in several of
the rivers of Scotland, such as the Tay, Earn, and Teith in Perthshire;
the Dee, the Don, and the Ythan in Aberdeenshire; the Spey
and Findhorn in Inverness-shire, and also the classic Doon of Burns,
the Nith, the Annan and others in southern Scotland; however, it is
rare in the Clyde and the Tweed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Teith has long been famed for pearl-bearing, though like other
rivers it has become nearly fished out. The Tay produces many pearls,
yet as a rule they are not of the best class. Some of its tributaries, as
the Tummel and the Isla, also bear pearls; those in the Isla are usually
fine and rank higher than those from the Tay. The Earn is also
famous for the fine quality of its pearls, but the whole river was
robbed of its wealth some years ago by a body of professional fishermen,
and it has not yet recovered from the raid; few pearls now exist
there save in the deeper pools, where doubtless may still be hid “full
many a gem of purest ray serene.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>In Ireland pearls have been found principally in the rivers of counties
Kerry, Donegal, Tyrone, Antrum, etc. In an article in “The
Field,” December 10, 1864, Mr. F. T. Buckland stated that they
abound near Oughterard, and that a man called “Jemmy the Pearl-catcher,”
who lived there, told him that he knew when a mussel had a
pearl in it even without opening the shell, because “she [the mussel]
sits upright with her mouth in the mud, and her back is crooked,”
that is, corrugated like a ram’s horn. Pearls are yet found in several
localities in the Emerald Isle, notably in the river Bann in the northeastern
part and in the beautiful Connemara district in western Ireland.
In 1892 the Bann yielded one of the choicest pearls that ever
came from Ireland. Within the last twelve months Lady Dudley,
wife of the Viceroy of Ireland, presented to Queen Alexandra a
number of pearls from the Connemara. These were mounted in
a green enameled brooch, and excited so much admiration that an
active demand for similar gems quickly developed in County Galway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. D. MacGregor, a well-known jeweler of Perth, to whom we
are indebted for much information relative to pearls in Scotland,
states that no attention whatever is given to conserving the mussel;
on the contrary, the waters are unscrupulously despoiled by the
greedy pearl fisherman who destroys all that he finds, since, by
chance, they may yield the coveted gem. Immense numbers are thus
wantonly destroyed, which if allowed to grow and propagate would
be more likely to contribute to the pearl yield, as it is well known that
it is the aged mussels in which a pearl is most likely to be found.
There is no close time, and so extensive have been the raids upon the
mussels in recent years that they have been rapidly exterminated in
places accessible to the fishermen; and should the spoliation continue
and extend to the deep waters, the pearl-mussel may soon become
extinct.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearl fishing is not prosecuted throughout the year, as it can be
carried on only in the dry season when the waters are low. There are
a number of professional fishermen who search in their favorite
streams, and sometimes very profitably, as much as £200 having been
gained in a single season by one fisherman. One of the most noted of
these was “Pearl Johnnie,” who a few years ago hailed from Compar-Angus,
in Perthshire, and who styled himself “Pearl Fisher to the
Prince of Wales,” by reason of some dealings he once had with his
Royal Highness. He was very successful in his experience of more
than thirty years. There is little mystery in the search; skill does not
always avail, and men, women and children are rewarded or disappointed
indiscriminately. The bed of the stream is searched until the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>patches of mussels are discovered, and this is usually the most tedious
part of the work. These may be in very shoal water, where a small
boy has only to wade with water above his knees and pick up the mussels
by stooping; but more frequently the water covers a man’s hips,
and at times he is immersed almost to the shoulders.</p>

<p class='c013'>The equipment of a pearl fisherman is simple. If he wades, he commonly
wears long boots with tops reaching to his breast. Provided
with a pole five or six feet long having a cleft at the lower end, and
with a tube several inches in diameter with the lower end closed by a
glass, he invades the home of the pearl-mussel. Thrusting the tube or
water glass beneath the surface, he scans the bed of the stream, and
when a mussel is sighted, the cleft pole is brought into use and it is
picked up by means of these primitive tongs. Owing to the close
resemblance which the pearl-mussel bears to the stones in the riverbed,
good eyesight is required to avoid overlooking it. A bag by the
fisher’s side receives the catch; and when this is well filled, he goes to
the bank of the stream and opens his lottery, in the great majority of
cases to find that he has drawn a blank.</p>

<p class='c013'>A boat is seldom used, simply because it is not available, but in the
tidal waters it is indispensable. The “box” is a risky device for fishing
in the deeper waters. It is a small contrivance, somewhat like the
ancient British coracle, in which the fisherman sits or lies over on his
chest; venturing out in the deeper parts which can not be waded, he
carefully peers through the tube and draws up his find with the long
cleft stick. This is a tiresome method, but some places can not be
readily fished in any other manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Aberdeenshire, Perthshire, etc., there are a few men who regularly
spend the season “at the pearls.” The knowing ones dispose of
their best finds to wealthy residents or to strangers and tourists who
frequent the vicinity. In addition to these experienced fishermen,
many of the idlers and unemployed about the riverside towns, and
also the farm servants in the country, search the waters in their neighborhood
in the hope of picking up some gems. But very often it is
severe and disappointing labor, for the pearl-seeker may travel far
and endure privation and hardships for days, and yet, after destroying
hundreds and even thousands of mussels, he may be rewarded with
only a little almost worthless dross; but again and again he returns to
the elusive game, inspired by the “hope which springs eternal in the
human breast.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>The British pearls are in great variety of colors, but most of them
are practically valueless on account of the absence of orient or luster;
for one possessing the white pearly luster, fifty may be found of a
dull color and devoid of value. Many of these opaque pearls are dark,
lusterless brown, and handfuls of them sell for only a few shillings. A
large percentage are of a grayish or milky color, or of a bluish white
tinge; these seldom attain much value unless aided by excellence of
shape and purity of skin. A few are of a dark, fiery tint and of great
luster. Sometimes the pearl is of a beautiful pink tint, sometimes of
a light violet, or other exquisite shade. The fine pink ones are very
rare and are highly prized. The best are those having the sweet, pure
white light which constitutes the inimitable loveliness of a pearl;
but few of them are found even in the most favorable seasons, and
usually these are from the streams in the northeastern counties and
some of the streams in the southwest. Very few combine the qualities
of perfection in shape and luster; and the product of many seasons
might be examined in vain to furnish enough pearls to make a well-matched
necklace of gems weighing from five to ten grains each. But
occasionally beautiful specimens are discovered, weighing fifteen or
twenty grains or more. One found in Aberdeenshire a few years ago,
perfect in shape and luster, weighed twenty-five grains, and sold at
first hand for £50. Another one, found at the confluence of the
Almond and the Tay in 1865, weighed thirty grains.</p>

<p class='c013'>While most of these pearls are sold to jewelers in Edinburgh, Aberdeen,
Inverness, Perth, and other towns, many of the finest specimens
have gone into the possession of prominent Scotch and English families,
who have a fancy for collecting them. Queen Victoria possessed
a fine collection of Scotch pearls, choice specimens of many years’
search, obtained almost exclusively from the Aberdeenshire waters
which murmur round her beautiful Highland home. In 1907, a Scotch
pearl was sold in Perth for the sum of £80; this was of a good luster
with a bluish tint, it was spherical, measured seven sixteenths of an
inch in diameter, and weighed twenty-one grains.</p>

<p class='c013'>The falling off in the yield of pearls in some streams is credited to a
certain extent to the building of bridges and the consequent abandonment
of fords. This is based on the theory that injury to the mollusk
has something to do with the production of pearls, and that they are to
be found more plentiful about fords and places where cattle drink. The
theory is beautifully stated by the lamented Hugh Miller: “I found
occasion to conclude that the Unio of our river-fords secretes pearls
so much more frequently than the Unionidae and Anadonta of our
still pools and lakes, not from any specific peculiarity in the constitution
of the creature, but from the effects of the habitat which it
chooses. It receives in the fords and shallows of a rapid river many
a rough blow from the sticks and pebbles carried down in time of
flood, and occasionally from the feet of men and animals that cross
the stream during droughts, and the blows induce the morbid secretions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>of which pearls are the result. There seems to exist no inherent
cause why <i>Anadon cygnea</i>, with its beautiful silvery nacre—as bright
often, and always more delicate, than that of <i>Unio margaritiferus</i>—should
not be equally productive of pearls; but secure from violence
in its still pools and lakes, and unexposed to the circumstances that
provoke abnormal secretions, it does not produce a single pearl for
every hundred that are ripened into value and beauty by the exposed,
current-tossed Unionidae of our rapid mountain rivers. Would
that hardship and suffering bore always in a creature of a greatly
higher family similar results, and that the hard buffets dealt him by
fortune in the rough stream of life could be transmitted, by some
blessed internal pre-disposition of his nature, into pearls of great
price.”<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c017'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The small blue mussel (<i>Mytilus edulis</i>) of the British seas yields
opaque pearls of a deep blue color, but most of them are more or less
white in some part. Sometimes a shell is found in which a blue pearl
will be adhering to the blue lip of the shell while a dull white one
adheres to the white portion of the shell. These pearls are commonly
flattened on one side, doubtless where they have been adjacent to the
shell. None of them is of more than very slight value.</p>

<p class='c013'>Probably the principal fishery for the salt-water mussel pearls is
that in the estuary of the Conway in Wales. These are mostly quite
small and well answer the designation of seed-pearls, although a few
are of fair size. In color most of them range from dirty white to the
dusky or brownish tint noted by Tacitus eighteen centuries ago, but a
few are of a pure silvery tint. In some seasons London dealers have
agents at Conway for purchasing these pearls. The price is usually
from eight to thirty shillings per ounce.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls occur in species of mussels found in the streams and lakes of
Europe, in some of which the fisheries have been of considerable local
interest. It appears that these resources were exploited by the
Romans, then by the Goths and the Lombards, and later the natives
continued to draw forth the treasures which lay hidden about their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>homes. These pearls have attracted attention up to the present time;
and while they do not compare with those of the seas, either in quality
or in aggregate value, yet they are prized on account of their intrinsic
worth as well as because they are a product of the fatherland. In the
densely populated valleys, the rivers are so polluted by refuse and
sewage that the mollusks have been greatly depleted; but in the streams
of clear, cool water, draining the mountain regions of France, Germany,
Austria, and also in the rivers of Norway, Sweden, Russia, etc.,
the fisheries are not unimportant.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most celebrated of the pearl fisheries in France are those of the
Vologne, a small river in the extreme eastern part of the country, in
the department of Vosges. Its sources are in Lake Longmere in the
Vosges mountains on the Alsace frontier, and it flows into the Moselle
at Jarmenil, between Remiremont and Épinal. While the pearl-mussel
occurs to some extent in nearly the whole length of this river, and, indeed,
is to be met with in the wild brooks and forest streams of nearly
all the mountainous parts of France, it is most abundant in the vicinity
of Bruyères, where the Vologne receives the waters of the Neuré.
These resources were described in 1845 by Ernest Puton,<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c017'><sup>[202]</sup></a> and in 1869
by D. A. Godron;<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c017'><sup>[203]</sup></a> to whom—and especially to Godron—we are indebted
for much of our information.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fisheries of the Vologne have been celebrated for nearly four
centuries. Writing in 1530, Volcyr stated: “In the river Vologne between
Arche and Bruyères, near the ancient castle of Perle, beautiful
pearls are found. In the opinion of jewelers and artists they closely
resemble the oriental.”<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c017'><sup>[204]</sup></a> A few years later Francis Reues wrote:
“There is near the Vosges mountains in Lorraine a river fertile in
pearls, yet they are not very brilliant. The strange thing is that the
quality which they lack by nature is supplied by the aid of pigeons,
which swallow them and restore them purer than before.”<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c017'><sup>[205]</sup></a> In a publication
of 1609, this little river is represented in the frontispiece by
the figure of a nymph bearing many pearls, while beneath is the emblem:
<i>Vologna margaritifera suas margaritas ostentat</i>.<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c017'><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In his paper above noted, Godron recites several orders issued from
1616 to 1619 by the Duke of Lorraine, who then had jurisdiction over
the present department of Vosges, showing that a high value was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>attached to these pearls and that the resources were well looked
after. Writing in 1699, Dr. Martin Lister alluded to the many
pearls taken from the rivers about Lorraine and Sedan. A Paris
merchant showed him a fresh-water pearl of 23 grains, valued at
£400, and assured him that he had seen some weighing 60 grains
each.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c017'><sup>[207]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In 1779 Durival gave an extensive account<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c017'><sup>[208]</sup></a> of the Vologne fishery.
He records that for sixty years pearls had been abundant, but at the
time he wrote they were very scarce.</p>

<p class='c013'>Puton states that, in 1806, when taking the baths at Plombières in
the Vosges, Empress Josephine formed a great liking for the Vologne
pearls, and at her request some of the mussels were sent to stock the
ponds at Malmaison. It does not appear that any favorable result
followed this transplanting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Owing to the extensive fisheries, the mussels became so scarce that
in 1826, when the Duchesse d’Angoulême was visiting in the Vosges, it
was impossible to secure enough pearls to form a bracelet for her. This
scarcity has continued up to the present time; and yet in the aggregate
many pearls have been secured, so that there are few prominent families
in the neighborhood who do not possess some of them. They are
especially prized as bridal presents to Vosges maidens.</p>

<p class='c013'>While the Vologne pearls are of good form and of much beauty,
they do not equal oriental pearls in luster. The color is commonly
milky white, but some of them have a pink, yellow, red, or greenish tint.
In size they rarely exceed 4 grains. The Nancy museum of natural
history possesses one which weighs 5¼ grains and measures 6½ mm.
in diameter.</p>

<p class='c013'>In western France, according to Bonnemere,<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c017'><sup>[209]</sup></a> the pearl-mussel is
widely diffused, and in the aggregate many pearls are secured therefrom.
They are somewhat numerous in the river Ille near its union
with the Vilaine at Rennes; though small, these are commonly of good
color and luster. In the department of Morbihan and that of Finistère,
many pearls have been secured, especially in the Steir, the Odet,
and in the Stang-Alla near Quimper. Small pearls, frequently of
some value, are found in the Menech near the town of Lesneven, a few
miles northeast of Brest, the great naval port of France.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>The <i>Unio sinuatus</i> (<i>pictorum</i>), the <i>mulette</i> of the artists, which has
a shorter and smaller shell than the pearl-mussel, has also yielded
many small pearls of good quality, as well as shells for manufacturing
purposes. This species has been regularly exploited in the Adour, in
the Charente, in the Gironde and its tributaries—the Garonne and the
Dordogne and their affluents, and in some other streams in western
France.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a pearl fishery in the Charente River near the western
coast of France, and likewise in the Seugne, a small tributary entering
it from the south. The mussel is known locally under the name of
<i>palourde</i>. In an account of this fishery,<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c017'><sup>[210]</sup></a> Daniel Bellet states that in
the Seugne, where the water is shallow and clear, the mussel is secured
by entering the pointed end of a wooden staff or stick between
the valves of the open shell as the mollusk lies feeding on the bottom;
as the shell is immediately closed tightly upon the intruding stick, it
is easily removed from the water.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the deeper waters of the Charente, the fishery is prosecuted on a
larger scale. Until recently, the <i>palourdes</i> were caught by means of a
dredge towed by a small boat, which was raised from time to time and
the catch removed. Ten or fifteen years ago the scaphander or diving
apparatus was introduced, requiring seven men for its operation, and
by its use large catches have been made. The mussels are taken to the
bank and there boiled for a time to cause the shells to open, so that the
contents may be easily removed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The shells are examined one by one to find any pearls that may adhere
thereto, and then the flesh of the mollusk is crushed between the
fingers to locate pearls contained in the mass; this is done largely
by children, working under competent supervision. Many pearls of
fairly good size and luster are obtained. The flesh of this mollusk is
edible and well-liked in southwestern France; and the shells are also of
value in the manufacture of buttons and similar objects.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Germany the pearl fisheries are most important in streams of the
southern districts, in Bavaria, Saxony, and Silesia. The pearl-mussel
in these waters is not so abundant as formerly; yet, owing to the care
which has been given to these resources, it is probably as numerous
here as in any other part of the continent. The mussel rarely occurs
singly, generally in small beds or banks contiguous to each other, and
in some favorable regions these are extensive.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearl fisheries of Bavaria have been prominent since the sixteenth
century. They exist principally in the districts of Upper Franconia
(<i>Oberfranken</i>) and Upper Palatinate (<i>Oberpfalz</i>), the several
tributaries of the Danube between Ratisbon and Passau, and in those
tributaries of the Main and the Saale which rise in the Bavarian
mountains, such as the Oelsnitz, the Lamnitz, Schwesnitz, Grünebach,
Vils, and the Perlbach; also in the district of Lower Bavaria, where in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>nine districts alone there are one hundred pearl-bearing streams and
lakes, of which the most important are the Regen, the Isar, and the Ilz.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c017'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Early in the sixteenth century, the river Ilz had the reputation of
yielding the choicest pearls in Lower Bavaria. The right to them was
reserved to the bishop of Passau, and a decree was made in 1579 that
persons convicted of poaching on these reserves should be hanged.<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c017'><sup>[212]</sup></a>
Since that time there have been few decades in which the gems have
not been found in the woodland brooks and mountain streams that
flow through the ravines and past quaint, interesting castles of the
wonderful Bavarian highlands. Most of the prominent families in
this beautiful region have collections of native pearls, and there is still
some trade in them in picturesque Passau, at the junction of the Danube,
the Ilz and the Inn.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tavernier wrote about 1670: “As for the pearls of Scotland, and
those which are found in the rivers of Bavaria, although necklaces
are made of them which are worth up to 1000 <i>écus</i> (£225) and beyond,
they cannot enter into comparison with those of the East and
West Indies.”<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c017'><sup>[213]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The official returns for the Bavarian fisheries, dating from the latter
part of the sixteenth century, were examined by Von Hessling in 1858.
He noted many gaps in the statements of the yearly returns, partly on
account of the loss of the records and partly because the pearls were
delivered directly into the hands of the princes. The results of the
first fisheries are recorded in the district of Hals for the years 1581–99,
in Viechtach for 1581–83 and 1590–93, and in Weissenstadt and
Zwiesel for 1583. The range of the fisheries was enlarged through
the discovery of new areas during the first half of the seventeenth century;
but this was offset by the bad seasons and by disturbed conditions
during the Thirty Years’ War. From 1650 to 1783 the pearls
in the forest lands of the Palatinate were exploited regularly and uninterruptedly,
with the exception of the district of Wetterfeld and that
of Neunburg vor dem Wald, where they were prosecuted for a few
years only. From 1783 to 1814, they were almost entirely neglected,
and the take was confined to a few streams in Upper Palatinate
and in the Bavarian forests. In the former episcopal principality of
Passau, where, according to general accounts, the waters were rich in
pearls, the records were scanty previous to 1786; this was probably
owing to the fact that the head gamekeeper was obliged to transmit
the catch of pearls directly to the prince-bishop. The records for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>fisheries in the districts of Rehau and Kulmbach began with the year
1733.</p>

<p class='c013'>From these fragmentary returns—making no estimate for the years
for which there were no figures available—Von Hessling found that
from 1600 to 1857 there were taken 15,326 pearls of the first class,
which were clear white in color and of good luster; 27,662 pearls of
the second class, which were somewhat deficient in luster, and 251,778
pearls of the third or poorest class, or “<i>Sandperlen</i>,” which, though of
poor quality, had sufficient whiteness and luster to be used as ornaments.
Had the records been complete, these figures would probably
have been at least fifty per cent. greater, or a total of about 445,000
pearls in the 257 years. In the last forty-three years of this period,
for which the records are fairly complete, the annual average was 208
pearls of the first, 395 of the second, and 3091 of the third class, a
total each year of 3694 pearls of all grades. This was divided among
the districts as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>Probably the most interesting of the pearl fisheries in Germany are
those prosecuted in the extreme southwestern part of the kingdom of
Saxony, in the picturesque region known as Vogtland. This is not on
account of their extent, for the output rarely exceeds $2000 in value
in any season; but because for nearly three hundred years they have
been conducted with the utmost care and regard for the preservation
of the resources. Indeed, a record exists of practically every pearl obtained
for nearly two centuries.</p>

<p class='c013'>The waters in which the Saxon Vogtland fisheries are prosecuted
are the Elster River, from the health resort of that name to a short
distance below Elsterberg; its tributaries, the Mülhaüser, Freiberger,
and Marieneyer brooks; the Hartmannsgrüner and the Triebel
brooks, the Trieb, the Meschelsgrüner, the Teil, and Loch brooks, and
twenty-five or more small ponds.</p>

<p class='c013'>For most of the data relative to these fisheries, we are indebted to
J. G. Jahn’s “Die Perlenfischerei im Voigtlande,” Oelsnitz, 1854; to
Hinrich Nitsche’s “Süsswasserperlen, Internationale Fischerei-Ausstellung
zu Berlin,” 1880, and to O. Wohlberedt’s “Nachtrag zur
Molluskenfauna des Königreiches Sachsen,” “Nachrichtsblatt der
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>deutschen Malakozoologischen Gesellschaft,” Frankfurt-am-Main,
1899, pp. 97–104.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the year 1621, the electoral prince, Johann Georg I, reserved the
pearl fishery of the Vogtland in Saxony as a royal privilege, and appointed
Moritz Schmerler as superintendent and fisherman. From
that time until the present, this fishery has remained a royal prerogative;
and, remarkable to state, except at the close of the seventeenth
century when the father-in-law of a Schmerler enjoyed the privilege,
all the superintendents of the fishery—twenty-four persons in number—have
been direct descendants of the second pearler, Abraham
Schmerler, who, in 1643, succeeded his brother Moritz. The present
superintendent Julius Schmerler has been in charge since 1889.</p>

<p class='c013'>This fishery is conducted in accordance with regulations of the chief
inspector of forests for the district of Auerbach. The present regulations
date from June 15, 1827. In compliance therewith an inspection
is made of the waters each spring to remove all obstructions and
debris that would injure the resources; and, if necessary, entire beds
of mussels are removed from one locality to another which appears
more favorable. No mussels are opened at that time, for the real
search for pearls does not begin until the season is far advanced and
the fishermen can wade up to the waist in the water without discomfort.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Nitsche states that the whole pearling district is not searched
over every year, but is divided into 313 sections, each one constituting
a day’s work for three fishermen, and rarely are more than
twenty or thirty of these fished in any one year. Thus each section or
district is permitted to rest and recuperate for ten or fifteen years before
it is again invaded. Every mussel is opened carefully by hand,
with the aid of a peculiarly constructed iron instrument. By inserting
the edge of this between the nibs of the shell and turning it at right
angles, the valves are opened sufficiently to determine whether a pearl
is contained therein. If none is observed, the instrument is released
and the mussel returned uninjured to the water; but if a pearl is found
within, the shell is forced open and the find removed. In case small
pearls are observed which give promise of growing larger in time,
they are not removed, but the year is marked upon the shell with the
opening implement and the mussel returned to the water. It often
happens that good pearls are later removed from shells marked in this
manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>Complete records exist of the yield of this fishery during each year
since 1719, when the Vogtland passed to the electorate of Saxony.
The following is a summary of these records arranged in series of
twenty years each.</p>

<p class='c013'>In recent years the development of manufacturing industries in
Saxony and the resultant pollution of the water has greatly reduced
the abundance of the mollusks and consequently the output has been
much restricted. The average annual yield in the twenty years ending
in 1879 was 163 pearls; in the twenty years ending in 1899 it was 66
pearls, and in the six years ending in 1905 the annual average was 58
pearls. Owing to high water, there was no fishing in 1888; and with
a view to permitting the resources to recuperate, the fishery was suspended
from 1896 to 1899, inclusive. Omitting these five years, the
average yield during each season in the two decades ending 1899 was
88 pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the end of each season, the pearls secured are turned over to the
director of forestry for the district of Auerbach; by him they were
formerly sent to the royal cabinet of natural history, or to the royal
collection at Dresden, but since 1830 they have been sent to the royal
minister of finance, by whom they are sold each year. The total proceeds
from these sales now amount to about 55,000 marks.</p>

<p class='c013'>In former times, according to Dr. Nitsche, it was customary to use
these pearls in making royal ornaments. This was the origin of the
famous Elster necklace, consisting of 177 pearls, now in the art collection
in the Grüne Gewölbe in the palace at Dresden. Another assortment
in that collection consists of nine choice, well-matched pearls,
weighing 140 grains. For a necklace of Saxon pearls, the property of
a duchess of Sachsen-Zeitz, the sum of 40,000 thalers ($28,400) is
said to have been refused.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Prussian Silesia the pearl-mussel is found in the upper tributaries
of the Oder, especially in Bober River from Löwenberg to the
sources among the foot-hills of the beautiful Riesengebirge, in the Lusatian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Neisse to Görlitz, the Queiss above Marklissa, and in the Juppel
as far as Weidenau. The Queiss has been famous for its pearls since
the sixteenth century, and even yet specimens of great beauty are obtained
therefrom. As long ago as 1690, Ledel complained of the
diminution of the number of mollusks owing to their wilful destruction
by children; and in 1729 the government issued a rescript in Upper
Lusatia (<i>Oberlausitz</i>) recommending the care of the young mollusks.<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c017'><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls are also found in the White Main a short distance from its
source, in the head waters of the Saale, and in numerous other mountain-draining
streams of middle Germany. Indeed, references could
be made to the discovery of pearls in nearly every stream of Germany
at some time during the last three or four centuries.</p>

<p class='c013'>The records of pearl fisheries in the province of Hanover were
traced by Von Hessling as far back as the sixteenth century, when
they were prosecuted in the Aller, Ovia or Om, Lua or Low, and in the
Seva in the district of Lüneburg. During the reign of Christian Ludwig
(1641–65) and in that of George William (1666–1705), pearl
fishing was carried on by the state, and old records of the former district
of Bodenteich note the customs and practices of that period and
of earlier times, and the implements employed. In 1706, for instance,
265 clear and 292 imperfect pearls were taken by three official
fishermen from the Gerdauerbach. Gradually, however, owing
to indifferent management, the brooks yielded less and less; the government
seems to have entirely abandoned supervision of them, so
that, according to Taube’s “Communication,”<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c017'><sup>[215]</sup></a> slight results were obtained
in 1766; indeed, only a few pearls could be shown as curiosities.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c017'><sup>[216]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Regarding the condition of the Hanoverian pearl-brooks, especially
of those in the vicinity of Uelzen, Möbius wrote: “Uelzen lies at the
confluence of eleven small rivulets, three of which, the Wipperau, the
Gerdau and the Barnbeck, contain pearl-mussels. Fishing has been
pursued here for centuries, and there exists an old regulation of the
sixteenth century in regard to the pearl fisheries in the Ilmenau. Even
at the present day, hundreds of pearls are found here which command
a good price when they are bright and of good form. These
either have a silvery sheen or they are of a reddish color. The
season for fishing is during the months of July and August. The
pearls are usually found in deformed shells. Their shape varies
greatly; most of them are flat on one side. Naturally those which are
spherical are the best, but the pear shapes are highly prized.” Möbius
frequently failed to find one pearl in a hundred shells, but at other
times he came across six or eight in this quantity. Most of the mussels
are found in the deepest places, especially near the banks of the
streams. One end of the shell usually projects out of the sand. The
fisherman is represented as feeling about the bottom with his feet, and
when he finds a shell, he seizes it between his toes, picks it out, and
then places it in the basket suspended from his neck.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c017'><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>In Baden and in Hesse are small pearl fisheries. In 1760, Elector
Maximilian III sent to Mannheim, then in the Palatinate, eight hundred
living pearl-mussels from the Bavarian forests, and again in
1769, he sent four hundred mussels from Deggendorf on the Danube,
so that they might be established in the Palatinate. The mussels were
placed in the Steinbach not far from Heidelberg, where they thrived
so well that fishing was instituted in 1783. Soon, however, most of
the mussels became buried in the sand, and the remainder were transplanted
into a quieter portion of the Steinbach, between Kreutzsteinach
and Schönau, about five miles northeast of Heidelberg. Here they
seem to have been forgotten, and were left undisturbed until, about
1820, a fine pearl valued at two louis d’or was found near Schönau.
This discovery soon led to such reckless exploitation that the government
reserved the fishery as a state monopoly. The mussels were
examined and sorted, and a portion of the brook was specially prepared
for their reception. However, the cost of supervision was
greater than the proceeds of the fishery, and the business was rented
to private parties for a very small amount. This was paid as late as
1840 by the Natural History Society of Mannheim, the annual rate
then being ten florins.</p>

<p class='c013'>An effort was made nearly two hundred years ago to develop the
pearl fisheries in Hesse. In 1717, Landgrave Prince William requested
his cousin, Duke Moritz of Saxony, to send a pearl fisherman “to examine
some streams in his territory where mussels have been found
and to determine whether they are fitted for pearl fishing and whether
fisheries can be established.”<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c017'><sup>[218]</sup></a> In the following year, a member of the
famous Schmerler family from the Saxon fisheries was sent to Cassel,
but with what result is unknown.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the pearling excitement developed at Schönau about 1820,
Landrath Welker, of Hirschhorn on the Neckar, requested the grand
duke of Hesse to place him in charge of the fishery, and when the
proposition was declined, he formed a small company for pearl-culture.
In 1828 his company had 558 mussels, 88 of which showed pearl formations;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>in 1833, out of 651, 98 contained such objects, and in 1851,
117 mussels were found with pearl formations out of 867 examined.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c017'><sup>[219]</sup></a>
Owing to the policy of the company in selling the pearls only among
the members thereof, the profits were altogether insufficient to cover
the expenses, and gradually the fishery dwindled down until it was
prosecuted only as a pastime.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls are found in the province of Schleswig-Holstein, which formerly
belonged to Denmark, but since 1866 has been a part of the
kingdom of Prussia. Möbius relates that the Bavarian soldiers in
1864 collected large quantities of pearls from the streams of this province
and sold many of them to jewelers in Hamburg.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c017'><sup>[220]</sup></a> Most of them
were of good form and luster; milky white was the prevailing tint, but
some were pink and others were rose-tinted.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Austria, pearl fisheries are most important in the province of
Bohemia, where they are prosecuted in the headwaters of the Moldau
from Krumau, a few miles above Budweis, to below Turenberg, and
to a much less extent in its tributary, the Wottawa, on the northeastern
slopes of the Böhmer Wald or Bohemian Forest mountains. From
very early times the right of fishery belonged to those domains and
estates through which the streams flow, as for example, the cloister of
Hohenfurth, the domain of Rosenberg, of Krumau, etc. The Schwarzenberg
family formerly drew a considerable revenue therefrom. Over
a hundred years ago the fishery was actively prosecuted by Count
Adolph Schwarzenberg, who exhibited at the Bohemian Exposition,
held in Prague in 1791, an interesting collection of shells, apparatus
employed in the fishery, and many beautiful pearls obtained from his
domains. The fisheries of the Wottawa were noted in 1560 by the
Swiss naturalist Konrad von Gesner,<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c017'><sup>[221]</sup></a> and again in 1582 by the district
treasurer, Wolf Huber von Purgstall. In 1679, Balbinus referred to
the excellent qualities of the pearls, estimating the value of many of
them at twenty, thirty, and even one hundred golden florins each. He
described the methods by which they were taken, and also complained
of the destruction of the reefs by depredations of poachers.<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c017'><sup>[222]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The Wottawa or Otawa River has long had linked with its name the
epithet “the gold- and pearl-bearing brook.” Formerly, along its
shores gold washing was more or less carried on, as well as the fresh-water
pearl-mussel industry. At the present time, every third or
fourth year, these mussels are gathered, by means of small, fine-woven
nets, from the bed of the river, and a goodly number of pearls are collected.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>The reefs in the Moldau from Hohenfurth to Krumau were almost
entirely ruined in 1620 by the troops who were cantoned there when
the Bohemian Protestants were overthrown near the beginning of the
Thirty Years’ War, and they never regained the reputation they formerly
enjoyed. According to the Vienna “Handels- und Börsenzeitung,”
the output of the pearls fifty years ago in the upper Moldau,
in the Wottawa, and in the Chrudimka—a tributary of the Elbe—reached
in some years the sum of one million florins in value, and as
much as eighty and sometimes even one hundred and twenty florins
were paid for an individual specimen.<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c017'><sup>[223]</sup></a> These pearls closely resemble
those from Passau in Bavaria, and some approach the oriental gems
in luster.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the archduchy of Austria, pearls occur in several of the tributaries
of the “beautiful blue Danube.” They are especially important
in streams within the former district of Schärding, such as the Ludhammerbach,
the Ranzenbergerbach, the Glatzbachenbach, the Brambach,
the Schwarzbergerbach, the Mosenbach, and the Hollenbach;
those in the former district of Waizkirchen, including the Pirningerbach,
the Kesselbach, and many of their tributary brooks, and the
Michel, the Taglinsbach, the Fixelbach, and the Haarbach, in the
domain of Marbach.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c017'><sup>[224]</sup></a> Fishing in the Pirningerbach and the Kesselbach
was prosperous about 1765, and Empress Maria Theresa received
a beautiful necklace and bracelets of the pearls therefrom. In the
district of Marbach, the fishing was prosecuted as long ago as 1685
for the account of the archbishop of Passau.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Hungary from time immemorial, the native pearls have been
popular with the Magyar women, and very many yet exist in the old
Hungarian jewelry worn with the national costume. A century ago
there was scarcely a family of local prominence which did not possess
a necklace of pearls, although these were frequently not of choice
quality or of considerable size. With a falling off in the output of the
native streams there has been a great increase in the quantity of choice
oriental pearls purchased by the wealthy families, and some of the
most costly necklaces in Europe are now owned here.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the kingdom of Denmark no pearl fisheries are now prosecuted,
but three centuries ago the gems were taken in the Kolding Fjord in
the province of Veile, Jutland. The great Holberg, who ranks first in
Danish literature, wrote that the governor of the castle at Kolding
employed as a pearl fisherman a Greenlander who had come to Denmark
in 1605 or 1606, and who “had given the governor to understand
that in his native land he was accustomed to fish for pearls.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Being required to work continuously, both winter and summer, he fell
ill and died, and as no one else wished to pursue the occupation, the
fishery ceased.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c017'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In many of the Norwegian brooks, pearl fishing has been carried on
for two or three centuries, and often with satisfactory results. It appears
from ordinances dated November 10, 1691, May 14, 1707, and
May 28, 1718, that the fisheries were under special supervision as a
royal prerogative of the queen of Denmark.<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c017'><sup>[226]</sup></a> Jahn notes that in 1719
and in 1722, Saxon pearl fishermen were sent for. In 1734 Charles VI
of Denmark requested the elector of Saxony to send one of the pearl
fishermen of Vogtland to examine the brooks of Norway in reference
to the pearl resources, and to determine the practicability of establishing
fisheries there. In response to this request, C. H. Schmerler was
sent to Copenhagen and thence to Christiania, where he began an
investigation of the Norwegian waters, the governor himself attending
at the beginning of the work. So great was the estimation of its
importance, that Schmerler was soon afterward received in audience
by the king and queen of united Denmark and Norway at Frederiksborg
palace near Copenhagen, and was awarded a gift of one hundred
ducats and a life-pension.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c017'><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In 1751, according to Pontoppidan, Bishop of Bergen, the Norwegian
pearl fisheries were placed under the jurisdiction of the diocese
of Christiansand. Among the principal pearling regions at that time
were the Gon, Närim and Quasim rivers in the Stavanger district or
amt; the Undol, Rosseland and other brooks in the Lister and Mandal
province; and several streams in the district of Nadenäs.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c017'><sup>[228]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The returns from the Norwegian fisheries gradually decreased.
After 1768 the rights were leased, and the revenue therefrom was paid
into the royal treasury. Owing to small returns, this source of revenue
received less and less attention, and about a century ago it was altogether
neglected, although from time to time choice finds were made.
Due to unusually low water in 1841, a number of valuable pearls were
found near Jedderen in the province of Christiansand, some selling as
high as $300 each; several of these were shown at the London Industrial
Exhibition by the diocese of Christiania.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>The pearl fisheries of Sweden were noted, nearly four centuries
ago, by Olaus Magnus, Archbishop of Upsala.<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c017'><sup>[229]</sup></a> The gems were
sought for by expert fishermen in the interior districts, and were
brought in large quantities to the coasts for sale, the women and girls
of all classes, rich and poor, using them extensively in personal decoration.</p>

<p class='c013'>The celebrated Linnæus left a detailed account of the method by
which mussels were caught in Sweden nearly two centuries ago. He
wrote: “In the summer season, if the water is shallow, the fishermen
wade in the stream and gather the mussels with their hands. Should
the water be deeper, they dive for the mussels and place such as they
find in a vessel made of birch bark, which they carry with them. Sunny
days are selected, because then they can see deeper into the water.
But, should this not suffice, they traverse the river on rafts which are
painted white beneath so that the bed of the stream may be illumined
by the reflected light. The men lie prone on the rafts and look down
into the depths so that they may immediately seize with wooden tongs
the mussels which they discover. Or else, hanging by their hands to
the rafts, they seize them in the water with their toes. If the water is
too deep even for this, they dive and feel around on the bottom with
their hands until it becomes necessary to rise again to the surface in
order to breathe. However, out of a hundred mussels, scarcely one
contains a good pearl; but sometimes as many as twenty pearls of the
size of a grain of sand are found in one shell. Many of the larger
pearls are reddish or dark, but occasionally a beautiful white pearl is
hidden under such a covering; although, naturally, it is rare that this
is altogether perfect. It has been noted that mussels seven years old
contain pearls; and in each of two mussels eighteen years old, a pearl
was found attached to the shell.”<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c017'><sup>[230]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The list of streams in Sweden from which pearls were taken, as
noted by Olaf Maimer, J. Fischerstein, and Gissler<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c017'><sup>[231]</sup></a> a century and a
half ago, seems to cover nearly all the rivers and brooks which flow
from the mountains of this beautiful country.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Russia the love for the pearl has been almost as great as in Persia
and India. During the Middle Ages, pearls were worn upon the
clothes of nearly all well-to-do Russians. The great head-dresses of the
women were ornamented with them; and they were used in decorating
the stoles, vestments, crosses, and the priceless relics in the churches.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearl-mussel is found in very many of the Russian streams. It
occurs throughout Archangel, in most of the rivers which flow into
the White Sea, into Lake Ladoga, Lake Onega, and the Baltic Sea;
and likewise in the Volga watershed. Von Hessling states that east
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>of the Volga its southern boundary extends to Lat. 56°, while on the
west it extends further southward, so that in the region of the Dnieper
it reaches Lat. 51°. The extreme southern limit is near the mouth of
the Don, about 47° north latitude.<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c017'><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In northern Russia pearls are secured in the provinces of Livonia.
Esthonia, and Olonetz, and in the grand duchy of Finland, where they
have been sought after for three centuries or more. Most of them are
bluish gray in color and they attain a maximum weight of about twelve
grains. Although not equaling the oriental gems, these pearls are of
good quality and are highly esteemed, not only by the peasants but by
the nobility and by the royal family of Russia. For reference to most
of the historical data relative to the fishery in Livonia, we are indebted
to an account written by H. Kawall.<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c017'><sup>[233]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>So long ago as 1612, Dionysius Fabricius compared the pearls of
Livonia with those of India. Said he: “Nor should I omit to mention
that there are rivers in Livonia wherein large pearls are produced in
shells; and I myself have seen some as large as the oriental, especially
when they are well grown. But because the peasants of this region are
too ignorant to determine with certainty when they mature, they are
unable to collect them properly, and therefore the pearls have become
rarer.”<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c017'><sup>[234]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>According to Mylius,<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c017'><sup>[235]</sup></a> in the seventeenth century, when Livonia
belonged to Sweden, the pearl resources received attention from the
government. Charles IX of Sweden decreed October 22, 1694, that
the pearls therefrom should not be exported but should be sold to officers
of the crown at a definite price. In 1700, an inspector of the
fishery in Livonia, whose name was Krey, reported that the peasants
collected pearls secretly from the small rivers and brooks, and forwarded
them to Moscow for sale. As the peasants objected to selling
them to the king’s commissioners at the prices fixed, the fishery soon
dwindled in extent. However, on the annexation of Livonia to Russia
in 1712, and the removal of these restrictions, it revived and became of
local importance during the last years of the reign of Peter the Great.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1742 the Livonian fishery was reorganized at the suggestion of a
Swede named Hedenberg. Furnished by the government with funds
and an escort, he began an exploration of the pearl-bearing waters,
commencing with Lake Kolk, where he secured many pearls of value,
some of which were presented to Empress Elizabeth.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c017'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>The fishery then came into great favor. To the nobility of Livonia,
in whose domains the brooks were situated, the crown accorded sixty
rubles for each half ounce of choice pearls secured, and for every
half ounce of the second class, thirty rubles; but the nobles were
obliged to renounce their rights to the fisheries and to permit the lakes
and brooks to be guarded by imperial soldiers. Owing to the very
great destruction of mussels which yielded no pearls, a reward was
offered to any one who would discover a method of determining from
external characteristics those individual shells which contain gems of
value.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1746, when the Empress Elizabeth passed the summer in Livonia,
large quantities of pearls from the neighboring brooks were presented
to her. But, owing to the cost of supervision, the expenditures soon
exceeded the revenues and the government abandoned the guard and
dismissed the fishermen. Little by little the search decreased, and by
1774 relatively few pearls were found.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c017'><sup>[237]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>According to Hupel, the Schwarzbach River, near Werro, was celebrated
for its pearls, which were noted for their size and beauty; one
of the tributaries of this river is named Perlenbach (Pearl Brook).
The Ammat and Tirse streams, and forty other brooks and lakes also
yielded them. Pearls of slight value were likewise produced in the
Palze and the Rause, near Palzmar; the Paddez, a tributary of the
Evest which empties into the Düna, and the Voidau and the Petribach,
each of which flows into the Schwarzbach. Near the Tirse was a very
old road house, patronized by the peasants, which from time immemorial
had borne the name Pehrlu-kroghs (Pearl Tavern).</p>

<p class='c013'>Formerly some of the brooks of Esthonia on the Gulf of Finland,
and principally those near Kolk and the adjacent lakes, furnished
beautiful pearls. From these waters came the beautiful necklace which
is yet an heirloom in the Kolk family. The choicest of these weighed
from five to ten grains, and the color was grayish blue. The Emperor
Alexander I is said to have received a present of pearls collected in the
vicinity of Tammerfors, in the government of Tavastehus, in the
grand duchy of Finland. The development of manufacturing in that
region, however, has destroyed most of the mussels.</p>

<p class='c013'>Von Hessling notes that in the province of Olonetz, pearls are
found in the Poventshanka, in the Ostjor, and in the Kums, where they
are secured by the neighboring peasants who sometimes make valuable
finds.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c017'><sup>[238]</sup></a> When the brooks dry up, the mussels are easily secured; old
inhabitants note that on one occasion of this kind many superb pearls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>were found in the Poventshanka, and a necklace of them was presented
to the Empress Catherine Alexievna. These pearls rarely leave the
province in which they are collected, as the inhabitants are fond of
using them for personal decoration. Young girls attend to the fishing,
and workmen pierce them for about two copecks each. Choice ones sell
for thirty to one hundred rubles apiece.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the government of Archangel pearls have been collected for centuries
from the streams flowing into the White Sea and the Arctic
Ocean. An extended account of the fisheries of this region was given
by Von Middendorff.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c017'><sup>[239]</sup></a> He states that the <i>Unio margaritifera</i> inhabits
all the rivers in which the descent is not too rapid, and especially in the
Tjura, the Tuloma, the Kovda, Kereda, the Kanda, etc. The fisheries
have been conducted exclusively by the shore Laplanders; but they
have been neglected in recent years owing to the small returns. Von
Hessling notes that the pearls are dull in color; in the opinion of the
fishermen this is caused by the mysterious influence of the copper
money which they carry with them. The Tuloma was formerly a
productive river; its pearls were sold in Kola, whence they were carried
to Archangel, 335 miles distant, where they were pierced by expert
workmen. The Tjura also yielded many pearls; but since a Laplander
was drowned while fishing for them, a legend has spread that
the spirit of the river guards the pearls, and the natives hesitate about
seeking them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Probably the occurrence of so many in the home streams had much
to do with developing in Russia that great love for the pearl which has
made it the national ornament, all classes finding pleasure in its possession.
While the superb gems treasured by the nobility are mostly
from oriental seas, a considerable percentage of those worn by the
peasantry are from the native waters. An interesting account of this
fondness among a certain class of Russian women—the Jewesses of
Little Russia—was given sixty years ago by the German traveler
Kohl.</p>

with very unimportant modifications, has almost always the same form; the
only difference is that, in the case of the wealthy, the pearls are larger, and
sometimes a number of small pearls and precious stones are suspended here
and there, set in the same way as the earrings of our ladies. It is common for
them to wear half their fortune on their heads in this way. For these caps
generally cost from five hundred to one thousand roubles, and many are worth
five or six thousand and even more; they wear them every day, holidays as
well as ordinary days, and strut around the kitchens and cellars with their
“mushka.” They spend their last penny in order to secure such a pearl-cap,
and even when they are clad in rags their head is covered with pearls. In order
to furnish the requisite material for this wide-spread fashion, the commerce in
pearls of Odessa, Taganrog and some other places in southern Russia is not
unimportant. There may live in the region where the pearl-caps of which I
speak are worn at least 2,000,000 Jewesses. Let us estimate that among them
there are but 300,000 adults, and that only half of these, 150,000, wear pearl-caps
(only the most indigent and the most aristocratic do not wear the
“mushka”); let us then estimate the average value of such a cap at only five
hundred roubles—these are the lowest minima and fall far short of the real
figures—and we have a total capital of 76,000,000 roubles, which the Jewesses
of this region wear upon their heads. Naturally the annual diminution of this
capital is small, since these pearls are transmitted from the mothers to their
daughters and granddaughters. Still, if we estimate that they last for a century,
the necessary yearly contribution amounts to nearly one million. It is,
however, probable that a much larger capital is employed in the commerce of
pearls. They are, for the most part, oriental and come by way of Turkey and
Odessa or else by way of Armenia and Tiflis. We inquired of our beautiful
Jewess whether she was not in perpetual dread on account of her pearl-cap,
and how she protected it from thieves. She answered that she wore it on her
head all day and at night placed it in a casket which rested under her pillow.
So that the whole short life of these Jewesses of the steppes revolves around
their pearl-cap as the earth does around the sun.<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c017'><sup>[240]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Several species of marine mollusks on the coasts of Europe yield
pearly formations, but none of much ornamental or commercial value.
Probably the most interesting of these are from the Pinna on the
Mediterranean coasts, and especially on the coast of Sardinia and the
shores of the Adriatic. An interesting collection of these Pinna pearls
was furnished to the writers by Alexandro Castellani of Rome.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>Gathering pearl shells and pearls is the principal industry
of the semi-amphibious natives of the hundreds of palm-crowned
and foam-girdled islands of the southern Pacific,
commonly known as the South Sea Islands. Among these
the most prominent for pearl fishing are the Tuamotu Islands or Low
Archipelago, the Society Islands, the Marquesas, the Fiji Islands, Penrhyn
or Tongareva, and New Caledonia. These are under the protection
of the French government, except Fiji and Penrhyn, which
belong to Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Almost ever since the South Sea Islands have been known to civilization
they have contributed pearls; and the fishery has been one of
the principal industries, not only for the natives, but also for the not
inconsiderable number of sailors who, preferring the lotus on shore
to the salt pork and monotony of ship life, have yielded to the insular
attractions and formed domestic ties. The industry has been especially
extensive during the last seventy years, when there has been a profitable
market for the shells. Most of the natives—men, women, and
children—follow it for a living. Domestic duties rest very lightly
upon the women, and many of these, and even young girls, find employment
in diving, in which at moderate depths these dusky mermaids
are nearly, if not quite as expert as the men and boys.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tahiti, the largest of the eleven Society Islands, is the center of the
pearling industry of French Oceanica. It is situated in about Lat.
17° S. and Long. 150° W., and has an area of approximately 410 square
miles and a population of 11,000, nearly one half of whom live in Papeiti,
the principal town. This is one of the most agreeable of the
“Summer Isles of Eden,” Nature furnishing food in abundance, and
climate and social customs requiring little in the way of dress and
habitation. Notwithstanding its importance as the headquarters of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>the pearling industry, few pearl-oysters are caught at Tahiti, most of
them coming from the archipelagoes of Tuamotu, Gambier, and occasionally
Tubai.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Tuamotu Archipelago is the scene of the principal pearl fisheries
of the South Seas; and from the local importance of this industry the
group is sometimes called the Pearl Islands. These coral-formed
islands are strung out for a distance of 900 miles in a northwest and
southeast direction, and extend from Lat. 14° to 23° S. and from
Long. 136° to 149° W. They number about seventy-eight, many of
them made up of small atolls only a few feet above the surface of the
ocean, and with an aggregate area of about 360 square miles. The
total population is approximately 6000, with many visitors from Tahiti
and other neighboring islands during the pearling season. The principal
products are pearl shell and pearls, copra, and cocoanut oil; and
nearly one half of the islands yield nothing but shell and pearls. The
chief port is Fakarava on an island of the same name, and the trade is
almost entirely with Tahiti.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the Tuamotus are of coral formation, they produce little vegetable
growth, and the people seem often on the brink of starvation,
forming a striking contrast with those of the neighboring Society
Islands. Drawing their subsistence entirely from the sea, except for
the native cocoanuts and breadfruit, these people have, at times, been
in great straits for food, and it was doubtless severe hunger that drove
them to the acts of cannibalism with which they have been charged.
And the sea which supplies them with food has also visited them with
great destruction. As recently as January, 1903, a great storm swept
over this group, drowning over 500 of the inhabitants, and destroying
a very considerable portion of the pearling fleet and other property.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearl-oyster reefs of the Tuamotu Archipelago are very extensive,
only eight or ten of the islands failing to contribute to the
supply. They occur in the protected lagoons of the atolls, where the
bottom is well covered with coral growth, with numerous elevations
and depressions of various sizes; and it is about the bases and in the
recesses of these coral growths that the best shells are usually found.
Most of them are of the black-edged variety of <i>Margaritifera margaritifera</i>,
which here attains a great size, reaching a diameter of twelve
inches in extreme cases.</p>

<p class='c013'>While pearl-oysters are found about nearly all of the Tuamotu
Islands, the reefs are richest at Hikueru or Melville Island. When
that lagoon is open it is the scene of the greatest operations, and it is
credited with nearly one half of the total product of the archipelago.
At the opening of the season, this is the resort of fishermen from all
over the group, even from a distance of five hundred miles, and thousands of natives camp in temporary leaf-thatched huts among the
cocoanut-palms on the beach, those from the different islands congregating
in isolated settlements. As many as five thousand persons
are sometimes brought together in this way.</p>

<p>THE PEARLING REGIONS IN OCEANIA AND MALAYSIA</p>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>The volcanic-formed Gambier Islands, with high peaks reaching, in
one instance, an altitude of over 1200 feet, present a striking contrast
to the Tuamotu atolls. This group consists of five large and several
small islands, surrounded by a coral reef of an irregular triangular
figure. The 1100 inhabitants of the Gambier Islands derive a large
percentage of their support from the pearl fishery. The patches of
pearl-oysters are located between the islands and the barrier reefs.
They are numerous about the island of Mangareva, which is well surrounded
by them on the north, east, and southeast. Oysters from the
reef of Tearae, which extends from the eastern point of Mangareva
to the small island of Aukena, a distance of two miles, are especially
rich in pearls. On this reef, where the water is from one to four
fathoms in depth, the mollusks are small, rarely exceeding five or six
inches at maturity, but the shell is very thick and coral covered; these
yield many pearls. In greater depths, the oysters attain a larger size,
but they yield few pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first white man to attempt the exploitation of the pearl resources
of the Tuamotus appears to have been Mörenhout. In a voyage
to the Oceanic Islands in 1827, he learned of the great wealth of
pearl shell, and applied to Queen Pomaré at Tahiti for permission to
employ the natives in the fishery. With an eye to business, she required
a fee of $5000 for herself before granting the desired authority.<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c017'><sup>[241]</sup></a>
Considering this excessive, Mörenhout attempted to deal with the
natives without permission of the dusky queen, but under these adverse
conditions he found the trade unsatisfactory and soon abandoned
it.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1830, and the years immediately succeeding, desultory pearling
voyages were made from Valparaiso, Chile, and these were followed
by expeditions from America and elsewhere. An interesting account
of the trade at that time is contained in Lucatt’s “Rovings in the
Pacific from 1837 to 1849,” published in London in 1851.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Mormon influx in 1846 resulted in a further development of the
pearl fishery; and Grouard, the local leader of that denomination, is
credited with making a fortune in the business.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the beginning of the industry up to 1880, when control of the
islands passed to the French government, it is estimated that about
15,000  tons of pearl-oysters were secured. The extent of the fishery
during the few years preceding 1880 made such drains upon the productiveness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>of the reefs that many of them gave signs of exhaustion.
With a view to adopting methods for conserving the industry, so essential
to the welfare of the natives, the French Ministry of Marine
and Colonies in 1883 inaugurated an investigation of its condition, and
of the possibilities for improvement. This was made under the immediate
direction of G. Bouchon-Brandely, whose interesting report<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c017'><sup>[242]</sup></a>
contains much data on this subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a result of these investigations and recommendations, a restricted
season for fishing was adopted, and only a portion of the
reefs was thrown open each year, a decree of the governor, published
in the “Journal Officiel” of the colony, determining the islands in
which the fishery might be prosecuted. This interdiction, known
locally as <i>rahui</i>, is for the purpose of permitting the oysters to develop,
and thus prevent the exhaustion of the reefs.</p>

<p class='c013'>By decree of January 24, 1885, a restriction was made against taking
shells measuring less than 17 centimeters in diameter on the interior
nacre, or weighing less than 200 grams per valve. But this was
repealed in 1890, and since then there has been no restriction on the
size of the oysters that may be fished.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearl fishery and the isolated leper station are the principal
claims which attract the attention of the outside world to the island of
Penrhyn or Tongareva, one of the Manahiki group, in Lat. 9° S., and
Long. 158° W. This desolate atoll island consists of a ring of land a
few hundred yards in width, inclosing a lagoon nine miles long and
five miles wide, and it produces little else than pearls and pearl shell.
The white gravelly shore yields little vegetation except cocoanuts,
which share with fish in furnishing sustenance to the semi-amphibious
natives.</p>

<p class='c013'>At Penrhyn the pearl fishery is carried on in the clear, limpid waters
of the atoll where the oysters are undisturbed by storms. The shells
belong mostly to the golden-edged variety, and are of good quality,
the value in London ranging from £100 to £250 per ton. Relatively
few pearls are found, amounting in aggregate value to only about one
fourth of the value of the shells. These are the principal objects of the
fishery; the finding of pearls is incidental, but careful search is always
made for them, and some choice specimens have been secured.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the coast of New Caledonia, pearling is of recent origin, dating
as an industrial enterprise from 1897, although previous to that time
some shells and pearls had been secured by native beach-combers. This
island is 220 miles in length and 30 in width, situated 850 miles southeast
of Australia, and about the same distance from New Zealand.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>It is a French colony, and has been used by that government as a penal
settlement since 1864.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1897, rich beds of pearl-oysters were discovered off the west
coast of this island. They are most numerous between the shore and
the barrier reefs on the west coast from Pouembout River to Gomen
Bay, and especially about the small island of Konienne at the mouth of
the Pouembout River. They are also abundant among the Loyalty
Islands off the eastern coast of New Caledonia, and especially at the
island of Lifu.<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c017'><sup>[243]</sup></a> The shell is similar to that from Torres Straits, and
the yield of pearls is very large. Several concessions have been obtained
to exploit these beds, one of them covering 130 miles in length.
The industry is carried on by means of scaphanders, in a manner
similar to that of Torres Straits. Virtually all of the catch is sent to
France.</p>

<p class='c013'>The natives of the South Sea Islands, and particularly of Penrhyn
and the Tuamotu group, are doubtless the most expert divers in the
world. This can be readily appreciated by those who have read of
Hua Manu in C. W. Stoddard’s thrilling narrative, or have heard the
story of the brown woman who swam for forty hours in a storm with
a helpless husband on her back. Accustomed to the water from infancy,
these human otters swim all day long as readily as they would
walk, go miles from shore without a boat in search of fish which they
take by means of baited hook and line, and boldly attack a shark single-handed.
Seemingly fabulous stories are told of their descending, unaided,
150 feet or more beneath the surface, and remaining at lesser
depths for nearly three minutes, far surpassing any modern records of
the divers of India.</p>

<p class='c013'>The water in the South Seas is wonderfully clear, enabling the
fishermen to detect small objects at considerable depths, and especially
so when using the water-telescope, similar to that employed in the Red
Sea fisheries. By immersing this to a depth of several inches and cutting
off the light from the upper end as he gazes through it down into
the waters, the fisherman can readily inspect the bottom at a depth of
fifteen fathoms, and thus locate the shells before he descends.</p>

<p class='c013'>The diving is quite unlike that in Ceylon and Arabia. The men do
not descend on stones, but swim to the bottom. The diver is stripped to
his <i>paréu</i> or breech-clout, his right hand is protected by a cotton mitten
or by only a wrapping of cotton cloth, and in his left hand he carries a
pearl shell to assist in directing his movements and in detaching the
oysters at the bottom. In preparing for a deep descent, he sits for
several minutes in characteristic attitude with hands hanging over
knees, and repeatedly inflates his lungs to the fullest capacity, exhaling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>the air slowly through his mouth. After five or six minutes of “taking
the wind,” the diver inhales a good breath, drops over the gunwale into
the water to give him a start, and descends feet foremost. At a distance
of twelve or fifteen feet below the surface, gracefully as an otter
or a seal, he bends forward and turns head downward and, with limbs
showing dimly in frog-like motion, he swims vertically the remaining
distance to the bottom. There he assumes a horizontal position and
swims slowly just above the ground, searching critically for suitable
oysters, in this way traversing a distance possibly of fifty feet or more.
When he has secured an oyster, or his breath is approaching exhaustion,
he springs from the ground in an erect position and rapidly
swims upward, the buoyancy of his body hastening his ascent so
that he pops head and shoulders above the surface, and falls back with
laboring pulse and panting breath. In case the dive has been unusually
extended, a few drops of blood may trickle from the nose and mouth.
His find—consisting frequently of nothing and rarely of more than
one oyster—is carried in a cocoanut fiber sack suspended from the
neck, or is held in the left hand, or may be hugged beneath the left
arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ordinarily in actual fishing operations, the fishermen do not descend
to greater depths than fifteen fathoms, and remain from sixty to ninety
seconds. Writing in 1851, a trader who had spent several years in
collecting pearls and pearl shells among the Tuamotus stated: “I timed
several by the watch, and the longest period I knew any of them to
keep beneath the water was a minute and a quarter, and there were
only two who accomplished this feat. Rather less than a minute was
the usual duration. It is unusual for them to attempt deep diving; and
let the shells be ever so abundant, they will come up and swear there
are none.”<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c017'><sup>[244]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>However, in mutual contests or in special exhibitions, reports of
twenty, twenty-three, and even twenty-five fathoms are numerous, and
they have repeatedly been timed two and a half to three minutes. Bouchon-Brandely
speaks of a woman at Anaa, one of the Tuamotus,
who would go down twenty-five fathoms and remain three minutes
under water.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c017'><sup>[245]</sup></a> This seems very unusual, but there are numerous reports
of two and a half minutes at about seventeen or eighteen
fathoms. In October, 1899, at Hikueru Island, another of the Tuamotu
group, a young native made an exhibition dive for the officers of the
United States Fish Commission steamship <i>Albatross</i>. He reached
bottom at a depth of 102 feet under the boat’s keel, and remained submerged
two minutes and forty seconds. The water was so transparent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>that he was clearly seen from the surface. After he touched bottom at
that great depth, he calmly picked over the coral and shells to select a
piece to bring up.<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c017'><sup>[246]</sup></a> The diver was ready to go down again only a few
minutes after he came up.</p>

<p class='c013'>In his work on French Oceanica, Chartier states: “There are three
women well known in the archipelago [of Tuamotu] who have no
equals elsewhere; they explore the depth at twenty-five fathoms and
remain not less than three minutes before reappearing at the surface.”<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c017'><sup>[247]</sup></a>
However, these unusual depths and extensions of time are
dangerous, and care must be taken or serious results follow. Most of
the catch is obtained in about ten fathoms of water.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the request of the writer, Mr. Julius D. Dreher, American Consul
at Tahiti, made inquiries among the South Sea Islands in regard to the
record of the best divers, and wrote as follows:</p>

<p class='c020'>Mr. J. L. Young, who has lived in these islands for thirty years, informs
me that he has never seen a diver remain under water longer than 80 seconds,
and that at a depth of twelve to fifteen fathoms. At one time he tested a man
who claimed to be able to stay under for three minutes, yet this man could hold
his breath on land less than 80 seconds by the watch.</p>

<p class='c020'>Elder Joseph F. Burton, who has spent many years as a missionary in these
islands, states that once in Hikueru, of the Tuamotu group, he went out in a
boat with the divers to time them. The best record made was 107 seconds, but
he was informed that there were better divers on the island than those he tested.
He thinks the water was ten to twelve fathoms in depth. A native of Takaroa,
named Metuaro, told Mr. Burton that he could stay under water three minutes
or longer. When these divers come up they take a breath and immediately put
their head under water to prevent headache.</p>

<p class='c020'>Mr. J. Lamb Doty, formerly Consul and now Vice-Consul at Tahiti, who
has spent eighteen years here, is willing to be quoted as affirming that he once
timed a diver who remained under water 2 minutes 35 seconds.</p>

<p class='c020'>Mr. Henry B. Merwin, a leading trader with the Tuamotu Islands, is willing
to be quoted as saying that he saw a diver remain under water 4 minutes 45
seconds by the watch. This is generally regarded, so far as my inquiries go,
as improbable; but most persons interviewed believe that men do remain under
water 2½ to 3 minutes. A native of Takaroa, named Tai, assured me in
the presence of others that there were twenty men in that island who could remain
under water 2½ to 3 minutes at a depth of twenty fathoms. He claimed
to be able to stay 3 minutes at that depth.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Diving-suits, or scaphanders, have been used at most of the South
Sea Islands, but in a very irregular manner. In 1890 the use of scaphanders
was restricted in the Tuamotu group, and by decree of December 28, 1892, it was interdicted altogether with a view to preserving
the industry to the natives, as it represents their principal means
of livelihood. The suit commonly employed at Penrhyn consists of a
helmet and a jumper, neither boots nor trousers being worn. Owing
to the absence of weights on the feet, it rarely but nevertheless sometimes
happens that a diver turns upside down, and the unwieldy helmet
keeps him head downward while the air rushes out under the bottom
cord of the jumper and he is suffocated. Also, when a good patch of
shells has been located, the temptation to remain down too long is
great, and paralysis often results. On the whole, these diving-suits
have proven very dangerous to the light, graceful swimmers of these
southern seas, to whom they are about as much of an impediment as
was Saul’s armor to the shepherd lad who slew the giant with the
simple pebble from a sling.</p>

<p class='c013'>And there are dangers also in nude diving, even to those who have
spent a lifetime about the water. Sharks and sting-rays and devil-fish
there are in abundance, and many of them know the taste of diver’s
flesh; on the other hand many a daring South Sea Islander could tell of
a fierce combat more thrilling than even those pictured by Victor
Hugo. One of the chief advantages of the diving-suit is that in case a
shark comes along, the diver can bide his time until the fish is ready to
leave, or he can frighten it away by ejecting air bubbles from the
sleeve of his suit or by other demonstrations; whereas a nude diver is
obliged to seek the air without delay, and in the retreat is seized by the
fish who, human like, has his appetite increased by the visible retreat
of the object of his desire.</p>

<p class='c020'>Not Schiller nor Edgar Allan Poe ever conjured up a picture more ghastly
than that of a Penrhyn diver caught like a rat in a trap by some huge, man-eating
shark or fierce kara mauua, crouching in a cleft of the overhanging
coral, under the dark green gloom of a hundred feet of water, with bursting
lungs and cracking eyeballs, while the threatening bulk of his terrible enemy
looms dark and steady, full in the road to life and air. A minute or more has
been spent in the downward journey; another minute has passed in the agonized
wait under the rock.... Has he been seen?... Will the creature
move away now, while there is still time to return? The diver knows to a
second how much time has passed; the third minute is on its way; but one goes
up quicker than one comes down, and there is still hope.... Two minutes
and a half; it is barely possible now, but—the sentinel of death glides forward;
his cruel eyes, phosphorescent in the gloom, look right into the cleft where the
wretched creature is crouching, with almost twenty seconds of life still left,
but now not a shred of hope. A few more beats of the laboring pulse, a gasp
from the tortured lungs, a sudden rush of silvery air bubbles, and the brown
limbs collapse down out of the cleft like wreaths of seaweed. The shark has
his own. (Beatrice Grimshaw in the “Graphic.”)</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>At the end of the day’s work, the catch is opened by means of a
large knife, and carefully searched for the much prized pearls. Usually
the fisherman finds none; occasionally he discovers a small round one
or a large baroque, and at long intervals—possibly once in two or
three years—his search is rewarded with a fine pearl for which he
may receive $50 or $60, and there is always the chance that the very
next oyster will disclose a gem which will make him independent for
the remainder of his life; and if no pearls whatever are found, there
are the shells, the sale of which furnishes sufficient to purchase tobacco,
knives, fish-hooks, the gaudy cotton cloths, the flour and other simple
articles of food, and especially rum, that fatal gift of civilization which
has been the curse of so many primitive peoples.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of the individual pearls secured have been remarkably large,
weighing 100 grains and over. Returning visitors from Tahiti, with
views magnified doubtless in proportion to the distance of the objects
of their description, credited Queen Pomaré with the possession of
some sufficiently large to be used for billiard-balls. Sixty years ago
superb pearls could be obtained from the natives for a few gallons of
rum or a small number of pieces of cheap calico, and several shrewd
traders made great profits in the business. But as trade at the islands
was open to vessels of all nationalities, the competition increased, with
the result that the natives gradually learned the high estimation in
which pearls are held, and in recent years it has not been unusual for
one of medium grade to sell higher in Oceanica than it would in
Europe.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is difficult to form a reliable estimate of the value of the pearling
industry of the South Sea Islands. The Tuamotu group, with 4000
fishermen, yields, in an average season, about 450 tons of mother-of-pearl,
worth about £65,000 in London, where most of it is marketed.
The yield at the remaining French islands is less than that
of the Tuamotus. Probably the total yield of mother-of-pearl
in all the South Sea Islands is not far from 900 tons, worth about
$700,000.</p>

<p class='c013'>No statistics whatever are available regarding the yield of pearls,
and the estimates sent from the islands are small compared with those
made by London and Paris firms who import the pearls. A large number
of persons living in Papeiti and many traders visiting the islands
depend very largely on pearl-dealing for a livelihood. From the yield
of pearl shell and estimates made by dealers, we are inclined to put
the value of the pearls secured in an average season from all the South
Sea Islands at about $125,000, only a small portion of which goes to
the fishermen themselves, the greater part representing profits of the
traders.</p>

<p class='c013'>As regards area of distribution the most extensive pearl-oyster
grounds of the world are situated on the northern and western coasts
of Australia. These are located within the jurisdictions of Queensland,
Western Australia, and South Australia; and extend in irregular
patches from near Cooktown on the northeast almost to Fremantle at
the southwest, a distance of nearly 3000 miles. Those in Queensland
are commonly known as the Torres Straits fisheries, as they are especially
important there; but they extend a considerable distance beyond
each end of the strait, and pearling expeditions are made from the
limits of the Great Barrier coral reef northward to the vicinity of
New Guinea.<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c017'><sup>[248]</sup></a> Those of Western Australia are commonly spoken of
as the Northwest fisheries.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fisheries of Queensland and of Western Australia are approximately
equal in extent, as regards number of vessels, boats, and men
employed, and the quantity and value of the catch, with the advantage
slightly in favor of the Northwest fishery in the last four or five years.
In 1905, according to the official figures, the Queensland fishery gave
employment to 348 vessels and 2850 men, and yielded shell and pearls
worth £135,000, which was the smallest output since 1890. The Western
Australia fishery, exclusive of Sharks Bay, employed 365 vessels
in 1905, and about the same number of men as in Queensland, and
yielded £196,000 worth of shell and pearls. The fishery of South
Australia employed about 60 vessels and 375 men, and yielded about
£25,000 worth of shell and pearls. This makes for the whole of
Australia, except Sharks Bay hereinafter noted, a total of 773 vessels,
6075 men, and an output worth £356,000. It should be understood
that the South Australia fishery is not prosecuted on the southern coast
of the continent, but on the northern coast, in what is known as the
Northern Territory of South Australia.</p>

<p class='c013'>Three species of pearl-oysters are found in Australian waters. The
largest species, <i>Margaritifera maxima</i>, which is by far the most important
and widely distributed, occurs to a greater or less extent
throughout the whole of this region. This yields the standard motherof-pearl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>of commerce. Although the pearls which it yields are
among the largest and finest in the world, this mollusk is sought more
particularly for the shell, the value of which from season to season
averages three or four times as much as that of the pearls. Ordinarily
this shell is uniformly white over the entire inner surface, and is commonly
known locally as “silver lip”; but some “golden-edged” shell
occurs on the muddy grounds in narrow passages between the islands
on the northwest coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>While this species is gregarious, it is not located in densely covered
beds, but is scattered in patches over the reefs. Some of these are
miles in length and contain scores of tons, but visually they are very
much smaller. The oysters occur principally on rocky bottom, and also
on clay and sand when well covered with seaweeds, but are rarely
found on muddy ground. They are most numerous in the channels
where the current is strong. The small oysters are generally loosely
attached by the byssus to rock, gravel or other shells; while the mature
ones lie loosely on the bottom or slightly turned in the sand.</p>

<p class='c013'>The second species of the Australian pearl-oysters, <i>Margaritifera
margaritifera</i>, is smaller, rarely exceeding eight inches in diameter
and a weight of two pounds. The distinguishing characteristic is the
black edge bordering the inner surface of the shell, whence it acquired
the local designation “black lip.” This variety is not rare in
Queensland, and in Western Australia its range extends as far as
Champion Bay in Lat. 29° S. However, the catch is small compared
with that of the <i>Margaritifera maxima</i>, amounting to only two or
three per cent. in Queensland. In 1905, the export of “silver lip” and
“golden-edged” from Thursday Island was 527 tons, and of “black
lip” only 11 tons; in 1904, these figures were 778 and 7 respectively.
In Western Australia the percentage of yield is much larger than this.</p>

<p class='c013'>The third species, <i>Margaritifera carcharium</i>, is confined almost
entirely to the limits of Sharks Bay, on the extreme western coast of
Australia. At maturity it is the smallest of the three, averaging three
or four inches in diameter, and about equals in size the Lingah pearl-oyster
of the Persian Gulf. The percentage of pearls therefrom is
relatively greater than from the larger variety; but, owing to its small
size and lack of thickness, the shell is of little commercial value. The
value of the output in recent years has approximated two or three
thousand pounds sterling, which is very much less than formerly, the
value of the shell having greatly decreased since the introduction of
the Mississippi shell in button manufacture.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearl fishery on the coast of Australia originated about 1861.
It appears that an American sailor named Tays was the pioneer in the
business; and on his death by drowning, the business was conducted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>by his partner named Seubert.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c017'><sup>[249]</sup></a> This was on the northwest coast, and
the output reached the market by way of Singapore. At first the
oysters were so abundant in shallow water that they could be picked
up at low tide, and beach-combing was profitable, especially when
carried on with cheap native labor. As the beach-beds became exhausted,
the natives were encouraged to wade out to greater depths,
and soon they became accustomed to “bob under” for those oysters
visible from the surface. The Australian blacks were thus taught to
dive, and in 1867 diving from boats in two or three fathoms was attempted
with such success that in the following year the practice was
generally adopted, the depth in which they worked gradually extending
to six or eight fathoms. In diving from a boat, the men imitated
“bobbing under” which they had practised in shoaler water; they
slipped off the gunwale feet foremost, and when six or eight feet
below the surface, turned and swam downward.</p>

<p class='c013'>Owing to the close labor relations existing between the natives and
the sheep-raisers of northwestern Australia, the latter were brought
into the business, and for a number of years pearling and sheep-raising
were closely associated. The blacks were employed in various duties
in connection with raising and shearing sheep, and it was important
to find some occupation for them when ranch-work was slack, not only
for their own subsistence but for the protection of the herdsmen and
their property. Fortunately, this opportunity was furnished by the
pearl fishery, for which these men were well qualified.</p>

<p class='c013'>The profits of the business soon attracted many outside capitalists,
and it became difficult to procure divers. Not only did the pearlers—and
particularly new-comers—resort to impressing the blacks into service,
but skilled fishermen were brought over from the Malay Archipelago,
and in some cases the methods used in securing them were by
no means regular.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1871 the Northwest pearl fishery gave employment to 12 vessels
of 15 to 50 tons each, and yielded about 180 tons of mother-of-pearl.
During the same year, in Torres Straits, where the industry had extended
about 1868, there were 10 vessels—mostly from the port of
Sydney—and the catch of mother-of-pearl approximated 200 tons,
valued at £60,000 in London.<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c017'><sup>[250]</sup></a> Each vessel was commonly manned by
two or three white men and from ten to fifty divers, who worked from
dinghys, in gangs of six or eight each with an overseer in charge.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the fishery increased rapidly in extent, the problem of securing
nude divers became a serious one, and “nigger hunting” became rather
common, the Australian black man representing the cheapest form of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>labor, working for his food, tobacco, and the simplest articles of clothing.
There was no complaint that the men thus impressed were
treated with inhumanity; on the contrary they were well fed and cared
for; yet, with a view to protecting them and preventing even a suspicion
of wrong-doing, the Australian government enacted regulations
restricting pearling contracts with the natives. Nearly every year
these regulations became more stringent, affecting the hours for diving,
and limiting the work to depths of six and a half fathoms, so
that the employment of Australian aborigines in the fishery became
extremely troublesome and annoying.</p>

<p class='c013'>The government of the Netherlands also placed severe restrictions
on the employment of natives of the Dutch Indies, requiring security
of £20 per head for the repatriation of each man; and the local chiefs
or rajahs also expected a rake-off before permitting their men to ship.
These Malays—from the islands of Solor, Allor, Adonare, etc.,—also
expected much better pay and better provisions than the Australian
blacks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following interesting account by Henry Taunton gives a
graphic description of the fishery as carried on at that time:</p>

<p class='c020'>The work was far from easy. It was exhausting and perilous for the
divers, and full of privation, exposure, and danger for the white men. Only
the hope of a prosperous season reconciled one to the life. When shells were
plentiful and the weather fine, the work was exciting and interesting enough;
but during rough weather, when one had to be constantly straining at the oar
to keep the dinghy from drifting too rapidly, or when hour after hour might
pass without the men bringing up a single shell, the discouragement was great.
The rays of the vertical sun beating down on one’s shoulders at such times
seemed as if it would never reach the western horizon, which was the signal
for returning on board.</p>

<p class='c020'>As may well be imagined, when three or four white men had to control and
compel some thirty or forty natives to carry on work which they detested, a
very strict discipline had to be maintained. It was the rule that no talking was
allowed amongst the divers when in the dinghy, nor were they even permitted
to address the white man, unless, maybe, to answer a question as to the nature
of the bottom, whether <i>nanoo</i> (sand) or <i>bannin</i> (shelly bottom), etc., or
unless some urgent necessity arose. Sometimes, indeed, I have pushed off
from the vessel’s side of a morning and have not heard a word spoken until
we returned on board at night, unless chance might take me within hail of
some other dinghy, when felicitations or condolences would be exchanged, as
good or bad luck might happen. At times, when the “patch” was small, the
dinghys of the whole fleet might be congregated on a very small area, in which
case the scene was animated enough. On all sides you could see divers slipping
into the water and others just coming to the surface, puffing, blowing, and
coughing to clear their eyes, ears, and mouth from the salt water—some with,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>others without shells. Others would be swimming to regain their dinghy or
squatting in their places for the few minutes’ rest permitted, and, if the wind
were at all fresh, shivering with cold; for although the weather might be extremely
hot, the constant plunging in and out for many hours at a time tended
to reduce the bodily temperature considerably. The white men would be seen
standing up in each dinghy. They were lightly clad, with shirt sleeves and
trousers rolled up, in all varieties and colours of costume, from the regulation
shirt, trousers, and felt hat, with leather belt sustaining sheath-knife and
pouch, to the more comfortable pyjama suit, or even the Malay sarong. Some
would be straining hard at the end of the scull-oar, forcing the boat against
wind and tide in the endeavor to keep it as long as possible on the “patch,” which
was marked by the discoverer’s buoy, which also might be observed nodding
on the surface, and canted over by the swiftly rushing tide. Others, their men
all being below, just kept the dinghy’s head to wind until, by judicious use of
the oar and well-calculated drifting, all the divers reappear on the surface
within a short distance from their own boat. This is the secret of saving the
divers from wasting their powers and time uselessly.... As may be supposed,
where the tide sweeps the divers along the bottom at the rate of three or
four or even six miles an hour, they have to be very smart in seeking and grabbing
any shell within reach. I have never tested them with a time-keeper; but
by counting seconds on many occasions, from the moment a diver’s head sank
below until it again came above the surface, I estimated the average time under
water was fifty-seven seconds. Part of this is of course expended in swimming
to the bottom, where they can remain only a very few seconds, as time
must be allowed for reaching the surface before letting go their breath. Practice
in ever-varying depths enables them to gauge this limit of time to a nicety.
But sometimes they cut things too fine, and then a catastrophe was inevitable,
unless much watchfulness was exercised by the white man, who has to keep his
eyes turned in all directions once his men are down. So long as a diver can
hold his breath the pressure forces him to the surface at a speed which seldom
requires accelerating by strokes with the hands or feet; but the moment he lets
go his breath—if under water—his upward course is arrested and his body
commences to sink. Now, when the white man sees this, either he must plunge
in to the rescue himself, or direct such divers who may be on the top to do the
needful.</p>

<p class='c020'>On a calm day, when one can see far into the blue clear depths below, I have
often seen one of my men shooting rapidly upwards until within perhaps a foot
or two from the surface, when a sudden gush of bubbles from the man’s
mouth would tell its own tale. Instantly he would begin to sink gently downwards,
and only quick action could save this diver who had miscalculated his
time. However, as it was not infrequent for divers to go down and never
come up at all, one may conclude that, where the time to be allowed is comprised
in so few seconds, even the most experienced make fatal errors.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c017'><sup>[251]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The difficulties in securing labor at length resulted in experiments
with the scaphander or diving dress, and gradually its adoption by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>most of the pearling fleet. The labor problem and the exhaustion of
the oysters in medium depths developed more quickly in Torres Straits
than on the northwest coast, and diving outfits were introduced there
about 1879, while this was delayed about five years longer on the
northwest coast. The outfit did not immediately supplant nude diving
in either locality. In 1883, only 80 of the 206 Queensland vessels were
supplied with scaphanders, the others continuing to use nude diving,
and even yet nearly one third of the vessels depend on that form of
fishery. Of the 353 vessels fishing in 1904, 108 depended on nude
divers and 245 were supplied with armored equipment.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1881 the Queensland government took cognizance of the rapidly
developing industry, and enacted a license system and other regulations.
For every boat under two tons an annual license fee of £1 (in
1886 this was reduced to ten shillings) was enacted, and for every
vessel of ten tons or under, the sum of £3, with an additional amount
for vessels in excess of that measurement; but not exceeding £20 in
any case.<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c017'><sup>[252]</sup></a> In 1886 it was required by the Queensland government that
every person employed “as a diver, and using a diving apparatus,” must
be licensed annually, for which a fee of £1 is exacted.<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c017'><sup>[253]</sup></a> And in
1891 it was required that “every diving dress and air-pump and all air-tubes
and gear used in the fishery in connection with diving must be
submitted to an inspector for examination once at least in every
period of six months.”<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c017'><sup>[254]</sup></a> The license system was adopted in Western
Australia in 1886, a fee of £1 per annum being exacted for each vessel
engaged in the fishery.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c017'><sup>[255]</sup></a> In 1891, South Australia adopted the license
system, requiring that every boat of two tons or under should pay ten
shillings, and that each boat over that measurement should pay twenty
shillings.</p>

<p class='c013'>With a view to protecting the reefs, the government of Queensland
in 1891 enacted a law forbidding the sale or removal—except for cultivation
purposes—of any pearl shell “of the kind scientifically known
as <i>Meleagrina margaritifera</i>, and of either of the varieties commonly
known as ‘golden-edged’ and ‘silver lip,’ of which the nacre or mother-of-pearl
measures less than six inches from the butt or hinge to the
opposite edge or lip, but this does not apply to the variety commonly
called ‘dwarf-shell.’”<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c017'><sup>[256]</sup></a> Owing to the difficulty in enforcing this regulation,
the size restriction was reduced in 1897 to five inches from the
hinge to the opposite lip, or six and one half inches exteriorly, shells
of this size weighing approximately one pound. It is claimed that
many oysters less than five inches in length are raised, opened for
pearls, and then cast back into the water.<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c017'><sup>[257]</sup></a> In 1899 the governor of
South Australia interdicted the capture in the waters of that territory
of any shell of “<i>Meleagrina margaritifera</i> measuring less than four
inches from the butt or hinge to the opposite edge or lip.” Competent
evidence exists that a good-sized pearl has been found in an oyster
measuring one inch in diameter.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>The fishermen of Western Australia rendezvous at Broome, about
one thousand miles by water north of Perth, the nearest railway station.
With only a thousand or so inhabitants, under normal conditions,
this is a scene of great activity, and bears a reputation of being
no Sunday-school when the fishermen are in, with tons of shell and
many a pickle bottle more or less full of pearls. Cossack and Onslow
are also important stations.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1905, 340 luggers and 25 schooners were employed in the pearl
fisheries of Western Australia, exclusive of Sharks Bay. Of this
number about 85 per cent. hailed from Broome. The schooners ranged
in size from 13 to 133 tons, and the luggers were mostly about 12 tons,
with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 14 tons. The total number
of fishermen approximated 2900, a medley of races, Japanese, Malays,
Chinese, Arabs, native aboriginals and South Sea Islanders working
together more or less harmoniously. The yield consisted of 1394 tons
of mother-of-pearl, with a declared value of £146,225, and about
£50,000 worth of pearls, a total of £196,255 for the year, which was
an increase of £32,286 over 1904.<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c017'><sup>[258]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The headquarters for the fishery of the Northern Territory of
South Australia are at Port Darwin. In 1905 this fishery employed
forty-nine sail vessels and two canoes manned by Europeans, and
two proas and twelve canoes manned by Malays. The crews, numbering
about 375, consisted mainly of Malays, Japanese and Filipinos.
In 1905, 42 per cent. were Malays, 24 per cent. were Japanese, and 20
per cent. were Filipinos. Owing to the low price of pearl shell, the
fishery was not prosecuted actively, and many of the Asiatics left for
the pearling reefs at the Aru Islands. The total value of pearl shells
reported among the exports for that year was £18,526; during the
preceding year it was £28,391. No record is available for the value
of the pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Queensland pearling fleet has its rendezvous at Port Kennedy,
Thursday Island, which was originally maintained by the British, the
Queensland, and the New South Wales governments as a harbor of
refuge for mariners. Politically this port is important as the strategic
key to the northeast of Australia, but its prosperity is almost wholly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>dependent on the pearl-oyster fishery. The population approximates
1600, consisting largely of Japanese, Malays, Cingalese, Pacific islanders,
and Australian aborigines, with specimens from nearly every
Asiatic and European nationality, and some from America and Africa.
The Japanese predominate, their influx dating from 1891; and at
present the industry is largely dependent on these Scotchmen of the
Orient for its most skilful workmen. The heterogeneous nationalities,
and the abundance of sand-flies, mosquitos, etc., make this island
rather less desirable as a place of residence than it is interesting from
a political and ethnological point of view.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Queensland fishery in 1905 employed 348 vessels, and yielded
543 tons of shell, according to the government returns. In 1904, 353
vessels were engaged, and the catch was 798 tons of shell.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the last fifteen years there has been a very steady decrease
in the average catch of pearl-oysters per boat in the Australian fishery.
The average catch in the Queensland fleet in 1890 approximated
7 tons per boat; from 1898 to 1903 it was about 3 tons annually;
in 1904 it was only 2¼ tons, and in 1905 a trifle more than 1½ tons.
The yearly increasing number of boats would naturally lower the
average, but the decrease is generally ascribed to the denudation of
the reefs, due to close working for thirty-five years without giving
them a chance to recuperate.</p>

<p class='c013'>The small yield in Queensland in 1904 and 1905 was due largely ta
the extended rough weather and the accompanying thick or muddy
water, which presented an obstacle to the prosecution of the work.
Mr. Hugh Milman, the government resident at Thursday Island,
states that each year the beds in the more sheltered spots have been
extensively fished, rendering it necessary for the fleet to go farther
afield in places where the depth of water is greater, and where the vessels
are more exposed to the full force of the southeast winds which
prevail for about seven months of the year, and which were unusually
severe in 1905.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c017'><sup>[259]</sup></a> The general denudation of the beds is not the principal
cause of the decreased take. An additional cause for the falling off
in 1905 was the deflection of a large percentage of the fleet to new
fields of operation, 110 vessels leaving for the Aru Islands in the
Arafura Sea, when the season was about half finished.</p>

<p class='c013'>For vessels using diving apparatus, the season continues throughout
the year, but it is frequently interrupted by storms, which may
cause the boats to lie in harbor for ten days, or even two weeks at a
time. The nude divers suspend work from December to March, and
also during the season of gales.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Each vessel is manned by a diver, his attendant, and a crew of four
men, who in pairs take alternate shifts at the manual pump for supplying
air to the diver. The entire force of men take part in managing
the vessel and in caring for the catch. The vessel is provided with
full equipment and supplies of food, water, etc., to last two or three
weeks, depending on the distance of the fishing grounds from the
shore station, or the frequency of trips made by a supply vessel.</p>

<p class='c013'>Except a number of owners and their representatives, there are now
very few white persons engaged in pearling in Australian waters.
Even the persons in charge of the vessels are largely natives of the
Pacific Islands. Owing to the hardships encountered and the small
remuneration, it is difficult to secure white labor; and aliens from
Japan, the Philippines, Java, Singapore, India and New Guinea, are
employed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The divers are of many nationalities, principally Japanese and
Malays, and the former are said to be the most efficient. Previous to
1890, they were mostly whites, and were paid at the rate of £40 per
ton of shells; but increased competition and the influx of cheaper labor
caused a considerable decrease in the rate of compensation, driving
most of the white men out of the employment. At present the Japanese
almost monopolize the business. Of the 367 divers licensed at Thursday
Island in 1905, 291 were Japanese, 32 were Filipinos, 21 were
from Rotuma Island, 16 were Malays, and 7 were of other nationalities;
this shows how completely the white man has been driven out
of this skilled branch of labor.</p>

<p class='c013'>The oysters are so scattered that considerable walking is necessary
to find them. They usually lie with the shells partly open, and in
grasping them the fisherman must be careful not to insert a finger
within the open shell, or a very bad pinch will result. The progress
of the vessel must be adapted to that of the diver, and when a good
clump of oysters is found it may even be desirable to anchor. If the
current and wind are just right, the vessel may repeatedly drift over
a bed, the diver ascending and remaining on board while the vessel is
retracing its course to the windward side of the reef. On new
grounds, the nature of the bottom is determined by casting the lead
properly tipped with soap or tallow, and the prospects for oysters thus
determined without descending.</p>

<p class='c013'>During good weather and in eight or ten fathoms of water, a
diver can work almost continually, and need not return to the surface
for two hours or more; but as the depth increases, the length of time
he may remain at the bottom in safety decreases almost in geometric
ratio, and he comes to the surface frequently for a “blow” with helmet
removed. Evidence secured by a departmental commission of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Queensland government in 1897, showed that in good weather at a
depth of eight or ten fathoms, a diver works from sunrise to sunset,
coming to the surface only a few times. In a depth of over fifteen
fathoms the attendant usually has instructions not to let him remain
longer than fifteen minutes at a time; yet a diver’s eagerness in working
where good shell is plentiful sometimes impels him to order the
attendant to disregard this rule. The very great pressure of the water—amounting
to thirty-nine pounds or more to the square inch—is liable
to cause paralysis, and death occasionally results. In working at a
depth of twenty to twenty-five fathoms, a diver is rarely under water
longer than half an hour altogether during the day. The greatest
depth from which shell is brought appears from the same evidence to
be “30 fathoms and a little over”; but at that depth—where the pressure
is seventy-eight pounds to the square inch—the fisherman remains
down only a few minutes at a stretch, and should be exceedingly
careful. The work is injurious, and even under the best conditions
the diver not infrequently becomes semi-paralyzed and disqualified in
a few years. Notwithstanding that the work is performed by men in
vigorous health, nearly every year there are from ten to twenty-five
deaths in the Queensland fleet alone;<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c017'><sup>[260]</sup></a> three fourths of these are due
to paralysis, and most of the remaining result from suffocation, owing
largely to inexperience in use of gear. From five to ten years
is the usual length of a man’s diving career, although in the fleet
may be found men who have been diving for twenty-five years or
more.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the vessels manned by Japanese, commonly several members of
the crew are competent divers and take a turn at the work, although
only one license is secured. Such a vessel carries only one head-piece,
but two otherwise complete suits, the helmet fitting either, so that as
soon as one exhausted diver comes up to rest, a successor is ready to
have the helmet screwed to his body-dress and descend without delay,
thus saving about half an hour in the changing.</p>

<p class='c013'>The nude divers in the Australian pearl fisheries are mostly Malays
and Australian aborigines. They work from dinghys operated from a
vessel, each dinghy carrying six or eight divers, usually with a white
man as overseer. The man in charge sculls against the tide to keep
the boat stationary over the ground, and all the fishermen of a particular
dinghy descend together for greater safety from sharks, and
to cover the ground systematically. On rising, each diver swims to
the boat, throws his catch over the gunwale, and climbs in to rest for
a few minutes. Sometimes two or possibly even three oysters may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>brought up at a single descent, but a diver is doing well if he brings
up one oyster in ten descents. The average daily catch of each man is
probably two or three oysters, but a fisherman has been known to bring
up fifty in one day. On some vessels, those who fall behind in the
catch are punished by extra duty aboard ship.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearling industry has had a marked effect on the industrial and
social condition of the natives of the Australian coast and the adjacent
islands. Many of these natives now have boats of their own, and
others seek employment on other vessels. Law and order and decent
respect for property have arisen, with schools and churches. The
result is all the more remarkable when it is considered that scarcely
more than a generation has passed since labor among the men was
unknown, the women doing all the work necessary to meet their scanty
requirements.</p>

<p class='c013'>As now carried on in Australia, pearling is a hard life, the men
working for two thirds of the season in a dead calm and oppressive
heat, while in the remaining months they are rolling day and night.
The members of the crew are not allowed ashore without a written
permission from the captain of the boat, and men and luggage are
searched on leaving the vessel. In addition to these objections, life on
board is not unusually made intensely disagreeable by the myriads of
inch-long cockroaches, which are attracted by and multiply rapidly on
the shreds of muscle left on the pearl shell stored in the hold. Storms
are frequent on the coast. In February, 1899, three schooners and
eighty smaller vessels were wrecked, and eleven white and four hundred
colored men were drowned.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the end of each day’s fishing, the oysters are cleaned of submarine
growths. Sometimes this is by no means an easy task, as many
of the shells are so covered with weeds, coral, and sponge as to bear
little resemblance to oysters. After they have been scrubbed and the
edges have been chipped, they are washed and stored on deck. Early
the following morning they are opened and examined for pearls.
This opening is done carefully to avoid injury to any pearl that may
be within. The hinge of the shell is placed on the deck and a broad
knife forced down so as to sever the adductor muscle, causing the
shells to spring open and permitting the removal of the soft parts.
The flesh is carefully examined, both by sight and by feeling, to locate
all pearls, which are picked out by hand and placed in a suitable receptacle.
Within the adductor muscle are found seed-pearls and small
baroques; the large pearls are found embedded in the mantle, where
their presence may be detected as soon as the shell is opened, the pearly
gleam contrasting with the light blue of the mantle. Sometimes,
though rarely, large pearls are found loose within the shell, whence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>they roll out when the shell is opened. Valuable pearls are occasionally
removed from blisters on the surface of the shell, or from within the
body of the nacre itself. Even when empty, these blisters are valuable,
and are especially adapted for brooches and other ornaments requiring
a broad and relatively flat surface.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the flesh has been carefully examined throughout, it is discarded,
as it is not considered suitable for food, and the shell is dried
for half a day or so to make the hinge brittle in order that it may be
broken without injury to the mother-of-pearl. After the shell has
been roughly cleaned, it is placed in the hold, if the vessel is operating
from a shore station, as is commonly the case in Torres Straits. Since
long exposure to the sun affects the quality of the mother-of-pearl, it
is important that it be kept under cover. On returning to the station,
it is thoroughly cleaned, assorted, dried, the dark edges clipped off, and
the cleaned shell is packed in shipping cases, each containing from 250
to 325 pounds. On the west coast, where the vessels at times operate
200 or 300 miles from port, the shell is cleaned, assorted and crated on
the vessels; whence it may be delivered direct to the steamers. The
Northwest shell is somewhat smaller than the mature shell of Torres
Straits, averaging about 1100 to the ton, whereas that of Thursday
Island runs about 725 to the ton.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is very difficult to prevent the theft of pearls by the fishermen as
they are liable to treat them as perquisites if not carefully watched.
Indeed, on the Torres Straits vessels it has come about that pearls do
not constitute a recognized source of income to the proprietors. There
the fishery is now conducted almost exclusively for the shells, as the
wage-earners secrete probably as many valuable pearls as they turn
over to the rightful owners. The hot sun causes many of the oysters
to open, and deft fingers quickly pick out such pearls as may be visible.
An oyster may be induced to open its shell by being held near the
galley fire on the lugger, and the insertion of a piece of cork holds it
open while a pearl is shaken out or hooked out by means of a piece of
wire. Then the cork is removed and the oyster closes again with no
evidence of robbery. The proprietors of boats who themselves open
the oysters almost invariably secure larger yields of fine pearls than
those who depend on paid employees, who rarely have the luck to find
choice pearls, judging from what they turn in. The government of
Queensland has endeavored to put a stop to pearl stealing, and by enactment<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c017'><sup>[261]</sup></a>
of 1891, it restricted all selling or buying of pearls within the
fishing region except through regularly licensed dealers, whose transactions
are open to examination.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the fishermen seem to have little difficulty in evading the laws,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>and throughout the fleet the men have become so adept that they regard
the pearls as their contraband perquisites. And the ease with which
these may be secreted is surpassed only by the facility with which they
may be sold, notwithstanding legislation to the contrary. Indeed,
some employers make no claim to the pearls found, thus enabling them
to secure fishermen at lower rates of wages.</p>

<p class='c013'>As previously noted, the pearls constitute only an incidental catch in
the fisheries on the Australian coast, but in the aggregate the yield is
very large. The yield in the northwest Australian fishery in 1906
is estimated at £50,000, local valuation; in the Queensland fishery
£33,000; in that of South Australia £5000, a total of £88,000 or
$440,000.<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c017'><sup>[262]</sup></a> Relatively few seed-pearls are obtained, and some of the
pearls are of great size. Some beautiful specimens have been found,
but usually they have less luster and are more irregular in form than
the Persian or the Indian output.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the remedies suggested for improving the condition of the
Australian pearl reefs may be mentioned the establishment of six
inches as the minimum size of the shell that may be taken (five inches is
now permitted in Queensland, and there is no restriction in Western
Australia), the closure of certain areas for stated periods from time
to time, and a limit on the number of vessels employed. The government
resident at Thursday Island, Mr. Hugh Milman, who has had
long acquaintance with the industry, strongly recommends the adoption
of a system of artificial culture; and in the meantime, to foster the
industry, “licenses should be granted to a reduced number of boats and
certain sheltered areas should be closed altogether for a few years
to give the beds time to recover. This latter procedure, however, the
pearlers themselves are not in favor of, as they are of the opinion that
the weather conditions against which they have to contend are sufficient
protection to prevent the denudation of the principal grounds.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A few years ago certain areas in Torres Straits were proclaimed
closed for a period against the removal of pearl shell; but, owing to the
want of effective patrol, the shell was poached to a very large extent,
and consequently the good that should have resulted from the experiment
was not apparent. Owing to the impracticability of continuous
patrol, and the want of proper legislation to bring die offenders to
book, it was decided to remove the restrictions.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Sharks Bay fishery, to which we have previously referred,<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c017'><sup>[263]</sup></a> is
prosecuted by means of small sail-boats using light dredges, except in
the case of the very shallow or “pick-up banks,” where the oysters are
commonly removed by hand. Some years ago this fishery was of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>much local importance; but the developing scarcity of the oysters,
and the present low value of this grade of shell in Europe, due to the
competition with Mississippi shell, have resulted in a great
reduction. In 1905, the industry gave employment to 17 small
boats and 42 men, of whom 18 were Europeans, 13 Asiatics,
and 11 aboriginal natives. The yield of pearls, according to official report
of the government of Western Australia, approximated £2000 in
value, and of pearl shell there was 88 tons, with a declared value of
£607. In 1896 the government of Western Australia surveyed the
Sharks Bay reefs, and opened them to preëmption in small areas for
cultivating this species of pearl-oyster. At present they are mostly
held under exclusive licenses for a period of fourteen years. The business
is under an elaborate system of regulations; but as appears from
the above figures the results have not been important.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls are more numerous in this pearl-oyster than in the two other
Australian species. In removing them from the flesh, a modification
of the Ceylon process is adopted. The mollusks are opened by means
of a knife, and the contents of the shells are placed in vats or tubs—known
locally as “poogie tubs”; and, exposed to the hot sun, are allowed
to putrefy. Sea water is added, and the putrid mass stirred;
after several days the water and the thoroughly disintegrated flesh
tissues are decanted, leaving the pearls at the bottom. The odor from
a number of these “poogie tubs” is said to almost rival that of the
“washing toddies” at Marichchikadde.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Sharks Bay pearls are commonly yellowish or straw-colored,
and sometimes have a beautiful golden tinge. Although obtained
from small shells, they are sometimes of considerable size—twenty
grains or more in weight, and fine specimens sell for several hundred
dollars each. China and India furnish better markets for them than
Europe or America.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>For nearly four hundred years, pearls and pearl shells have been the
most beautiful objects which have reached the outside world from the
many islands of the Malay Archipelago. On his visit to this part of
the world in 1520, Pigopitta, a companion of Magalhães, reported
pearls among the prized possessions of the natives. The fisheries have
never been of great importance, although the reefs are widely scattered
throughout the archipelago, and the possibilities seem favorable for
very great development. Thomas de Comyn stated a century ago, that
pearl fisheries had been undertaken “from time to time about Mindanao,
Zebu, and some of the smaller islands, but with little success
and less regularity, not because of a scarcity of fine pearls, but on account
of a lack of skill of the divers and their well-established dread
of sharks.”<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c017'><sup>[264]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Giacinto Gemmi,<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c017'><sup>[265]</sup></a> writing of Philippine pearls, repeats a strange
tale from the “Storia de Mindanao” by the Jesuit father, Combes, to
the effect that in a certain spot, under many fathoms of water, there
was a pearl of inestimable value, as large as an egg; but, although the
king’s ministers had made every effort to have it secured, they had always
been unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the last thirty years, pearls and pearl shells have been
secured from most of the inshore waters of Malaysia, but the output
has not been so regular or so extensive as the conditions seem to warrant.
Our observation leads to the conviction that this is not due so
much to lack of skill on the part of the divers, or to their dread of
sharks, mentioned by Comyn; but to the fact that foreign capital, attracted
to this part of the world, has found more security and profit in
developing plantations, and the natives have not had sufficient enterprise
to systematize and develop the fishery resources.</p>

<p class='c013'>Throughout Malaysia, including the Philippine Islands, the pearl is
known as <i>mutya</i>, <i>mootara</i>, or a similar name, closely resembling the
Sanskrit <i>mukta</i> or the Cingalese <i>mootoo</i>, indicating the source of the
influence originating the fishery and trade.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most widely-known pearl fisheries of Malaysia are in the Sulu
Archipelago, a group of islands comprising about 1000 square miles
in area, and containing a population of 100,000. The beautiful yellow
pearls shared with the many acts of piracy in attracting attention to
this group previous to 1878, when the islands were brought under the
influence of Spanish rule; and since the Spanish-American War, pearl
fishing has been the leading industry, though it has received less attention
from outside sources, perhaps, than has the existence of slavery
and harems as part of the social system.</p>

<p class='c013'>Writing in 1820, John Crawfurd stated that the annual export of
pearls from Sulu Islands to China approximated 25,000 Spanish dollars
in value, and the mother-of-pearl similarly exported was worth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>70,000  dollars. “Considering the turbulent and piratical habits of the
natives of the Sulu group, it is certain that a greater share of skill and
industry than can at present be applied to the fisheries, would greatly
enhance the value and amount of their produce.”<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c017'><sup>[266]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In the Sulu Archipelago, the pearl-oyster reefs exist from Sibǔtu
Pass to Basilan Strait, and roughly cover an estimated area of 15,000
square miles; that is, in the most favorable localities throughout
this area, pearl-oysters occur to a greater or less extent. The fisheries
are prosecuted by Malays and Chinese, and are largely centered
at Sulu.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearl-oysters occur about many other islands. They exist at
Maimbun and Parong; and also off the island of Tapul and its neighbor
Lagos, both southwest of Maimbun. In the channels among these
islands, on the rocky gravelly bottom where there is a good current,
oysters are commonly found. They also occur off Laminusa, northeast
of Tawi-Tawi, at Cuyo Island, and in the waters about Malampaya
and Bacuit.</p>

<p class='c013'>The large mother-of-pearl oyster (<i>Margaritifera maxima</i>) known
locally as <i>concha de nacr</i>, is by far the most abundant. When full-grown
in this region it is ordinarily between ten and thirteen inches
in diameter. The young oyster attaches itself to the bottom by means
of the green byssus; but after attaining a weight of one pound, it is
too heavy to be easily moved by the tide, and the ligature gradually
disappears. The Australian “black lip” (<i>Margaritifera margaritifera</i>),
known here as <i>concha de nagra</i>, is also found. In these waters
it attains a diameter of about eight inches, but most specimens are considerably
smaller.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is another pearly shell in the Philippines, a spiral gasteropod
known locally as <i>caracoles</i>, which is ordinarily five or six inches in
diameter, and has a beautiful pearly surface. This yields very few
pearls; it is sought for pearl-button manufacture, selling for about the
same as the <i>concha de nagra</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Streeter states that it is declared by the natives of the Sulu Archipelago
that pearls of a yellowish hue have been found in the pearly
nautilus (<i>Nautilus pompilius</i>), one of the group of cephalopodous mollusks.
As, however, there is a superstition that they bring ill luck, the
natives say that they throw them away, believing that any one who
should fight while wearing one of these pearls in a ring, would certainly
be killed. If we consider the habits and organism of this remarkable
animal, and the splendid nacreous coating of its shell, the assertion
that pearls are found in it seems quite natural. Indeed, the occurrence
of pearls in the pearly nautilus is generally recognized.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>For many years the successive sultans of Sulu exercised authority
over the fisheries and—in addition to exacting certain percentages and
presents from the fishermen—claimed as their perquisites all pearls
exceeding a designated weight. The fisheries were prosecuted by
nude divers, of whom there were a large number. A Chinese company
had been particularly fortunate in its relations with the Sulus,
and had an extensive equipment in the fishery, consisting of a number
of small vessels, each carrying a crew of seven men, who used diving-suits.
In addition to these, some of the native Moros owned boats
from which diving-suits were employed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Following the Spanish-American War and the transfer of the Philippine
Islands to America, several vessels proceeded to engage in the
fisheries without previously consulting the representatives of the Sultan
of Sulu. This called forth from that official an appeal to the American
authorities for protection in his claims. He gave an account of the
pearl fishery in this interesting document, which we quote at length—through
the courtesy of the American Bureau of Insular Affairs—because
of the light it throws, not only on the industry, but also on the
characteristics of these people with whom the American government is
now dealing.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>I beg to inform my father, the civil governor, Major Scott, as you want to
know about the mother-of-pearl shell, why it is the right of all Sulu people,
above all my own right, this is the reason:</p>

<p class='c020'>The forefathers of the Sulu people used to take the mother-of-pearl shell
from the downs because the mother-of-pearl shell belonged to the downs, and
they took them to eat the oyster with other food; of the shell they made plates
and saucers to put the food on, and the pearls they used to make a hole through
and put them on a string as necklaces for their children. This was at a time
when no other nation had come to Sulu to buy the mother-of-pearl shell.</p>

<p class='c020'>Later, a big boat, called the <i>Sampang</i>, wandered from China to Sulu; there
were on board many people, all Chinese; it was loaded with merchandise. The
people came ashore and saw the mother-of-pearl shell which the Sulu people
were carrying. The captain of the boat said: “Have you many more of these
things?” and the people answered, “Plenty; this is what we take from the
downs to eat with other food.” The Captain said. “Gather me plenty. I will
buy them from you.” The people went and gathered them and bartered them
for plates and saucers. When all the shells from the downs were finished they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>looked into the deep, and that is how they found the pearling grounds, and the
people noted them, and remembered them. This is what they agreed upon;
whoever finds pearling grounds they belong to him from generation to generation.
That is what they agreed upon. That is the reason why the Sulu people
have the right, and that they came to make the dredge (<i>badja</i>) to get the
mother-of-pearl shell from the deep, because they can not see them.</p>

<p class='c020'>Later Salips came from Mecca of the Arab nation; they came to Sulu to
convert the people into Mohammedans, as they had no religion. And when the
Sulu people, including the islanders, adopted the faith, then they agreed to
have a sultan and they elected Saripul Hassim to be sultan. Saripul Hassim
said: “I don’t want you to make me your sultan if I do not know what the
rights of the sultan are, and who I have to govern over, because this is not my
country, this is your country.”</p>

<p class='c020'>And this is how everybody agreed to accept him as sultan over Sulu and all
the islands; this is how he became Sultan and governed over all, and this is
how Saripul Hassim accepted to be the sultan of Sulu, to have full power over
land and sea, and the people’s rights, where they got their living from on land
and sea, were left to them, because they were the means of their getting their
livelihood.</p>

<p class='c020'>But a law was made, if they found valuables in the sea, such as pearls, tortoise
shell, ambal or anything extraordinary, they have to show it to the sultan,
and if the pearls weigh six chuchuk or over they become the share of the sultan;
if they do not have that weight, the people can do with them as they
please and sell them. If the sultan wants them, he will buy them according to
custom. As to tortoise shell, if they weigh two ketties, they go to the sultan,
and as to the ambal, whether it is much or little, it falls to the sultan. Whoever
finds it must take it to the sultan. Whoever of his subjects violates this law
as agreed upon, the sultan can punish him as he pleases.</p>

<p class='c020'>They accepted this law as agreed upon, to be carried out by them (sultan
and people), and their descendants, and not to be changed; but they asked of
the sultan not to let any other nation take a share in this industry; it is enough
for them; and the sultan agreed to this because they did not know how to earn
their living otherwise. This is what the sultan and his subjects agreed to because
the Sulu had no other treasures on land beyond the cultivation; the treasures
came from the sea only, therefore other people are forbidden because this
is the property of all my subjects, and especially my own.</p>

<p class='c020'>Recently, in my time and in the Spanish time, there came to me Captain
Tiana; he wanted to dive for pearl shells. I said “I cannot give you my consent
at once because since our forefathers (sultan and people) we have an
agreement, I will confer with my people.” I sent for the chiefs and the dattos
and I told them about it, that Captain Tiana came to me and asked to dive for
pearl shells. They said it cannot be done, because there is an agreement between
our forefathers that other nations cannot join in this industry of the
Sulu seas, because there is no other means of earning a living for your subjects.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>I informed Captain Tiana of it. He said: “Allow me to dive for pearl
shells, I will give toll to you as sultan and I will also give toll to the owners of
the pearl grounds according to what we agree upon.”</p>

<p class='c020'>So I informed all the owners of the pearling ground, and they said, “If he
is really in earnest to give toll to us owners of the ground according to what
we agree upon, if we don’t agree, we will not allow him to fish.” Thereupon
Captain Tiana and I went to the Spanish governor to bear witness. The governor
said: “All right; anything you agree upon; I cannot change the law of
the Moro people, and I will not interfere.”</p>

<p class='c020'>That is how I allowed Captain Tiana to fish, and I gave him a letter of
the truth according to agreement. Therefore if any person of other nation
wants to fish for mother-of-pearl shell, he will have to do as Captain Tiana
did, and ask me for a letter of truth, and if he has no letter and does not pay
toll to the owners of the ground, and especially to me, he cannot dive, and if
he violates this and if anything befalls him, I am not responsible and do not
want to be held responsible, because the mother-of-pearl shells are like the
property in our boxes given to us by God. They do not go away from the
places where they are put, they are not like fish that go about. Therefore, we
forbid it. It is our heritage from our forefathers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Following these representations, the legislative council of the Moro
province, by authority of the Philippine Commission, interdicted all
fishing for pearl-oysters within three marine leagues of any land
within the territorial limits of the Moro province, without license first
obtained from the treasurer of the district within which the vessel
carries on the major part of its operations.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c017'><sup>[267]</sup></a> No license was to be
issued to any vessel not owned in the Philippine Islands or in the
United States, and not wholly owned by citizens of the United States,
by natives of the Philippine Islands, or by persons who have acquired
the political rights of natives,<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c017'><sup>[268]</sup></a> except that foreign vessels which for
one year immediately preceding had actually engaged in pearl fishing
might secure license to continue therein for a period of five years
thereafter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Licenses were of two kinds, according to the nature of the fishery.
To engage in fishing with the aid of diving-suits, the fee was five
hundred pesos annually, for each of the greatest number of divers
beneath the surface of the water at any one time. For fishing without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>submarine armor, the fee was five pesos annually, for each of the
greatest number of nude divers to be employed by the vessel during
any voyage, and the same sum for each of the greatest number of
dredges or rakes to be employed beneath the surface at any one time;
but this did not apply to vessels under 15 tons, owned and operated
wholly by native Moros, until January 1, 1906.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was also made unlawful to catch or to have in one’s possession
within the Moro province “any pearl shell or any bivalvular or lateral
plate, or any pearl shell of less than 4½ inches in diameter, measured
with a flat, rigid measuring rod along the line of the
ligament which joins one binocular or lateral plate to the other at
the hinge, unless the lateral plate of such shell be more than 7 inches
in diameter measured with a flat, rigid measuring rod from the outer
edge of the horny lips to the center of the hinge, the rod being so
placed as to form a right angle with the line of the hinge.”<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c017'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>According to a report furnished by the Mining Bureau at Manila,
there were seven vessels fishing with diving-suits in the Sulu Archipelago
in 1905, each representing an investment of about 6000 pesos.
In 1906 there were ten vessels engaged in this industry, and the collection
on licenses for that fiscal year amounted to 3375 pesos. These
vessels are mostly small Moro craft which cannot venture upon distant
cruises in the archipelago for prospecting purposes, and their operations
are confined for the most part to the immediate vicinity of
Jolo. Each vessel carries one diver, a tender, a cook, and four sailors.
In addition to food supplies, the sailors and the cook each receive
twelve to fifteen pesos per month, the tender thirty to forty pesos per
month, and the diver the same amount and in addition thereto a bonus
of twenty cents for each shell secured. Near Jolo the vessels work
throughout the year, but farther north very little fishing is done from
December to April, when monsoons prevail. The man in charge
of each vessel is obliged by law to keep an accurate record of the
number and weight of shells found, and his figures are checked up
by a customs official at either Jolo or Zamboanga, the ports of
discharge.</p>

<p class='c013'>To enable them to secure pearl-oysters at depths of from twenty to
forty fathoms, the Sulus have long made use of a dredge (<i>badja</i>) peculiarly
constructed of native materials, and admirably adapted to the
purpose. This consists of five or more long wooden teeth slightly
curved and spreading outward, with an expanse at the ends of twenty
inches or more. The dredge is properly balanced by two stones, and a
bridle rope is so attached to it that, when thrown overboard and
towed behind a canoe drifting with the current or the wind, the implement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>rests on the curve of the teeth, which are in almost a horizontal
position. As the teeth enter the gaping shell of an oyster lying
on the bottom, the animal instantly closes tightly on the intruder and
effects its own capture. The principle is similar to that of the “crowfoot”
dredge of the Mississippi River, although the design of the
implement is radically different. A second rope is attached so as to
raise and lower the implement and to detach it from corals, rocks, and
other objects against which it may catch in its course on the bottom.
This dredge is designed for very deep areas, where the bottom is
relatively smooth.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Moros employ yet another method of fishing, using a <i>magtung-tung</i>
or three-pronged catcher, which is let down by a rattan
rope and by means of which individual shells sighted from the surface
are obtained. When the water is perfectly clear this implement
can be operated where the depth is fifteen or eighteen fathoms, but its
use is impractical where the water is clouded or there is even a slight
ripple on the surface.</p>

<p class='c013'>However, the bulk of the catch is made by the nude divers, of which
there are hundreds at Maimbun, Tapul, Lugus and elsewhere. In their
small boats these Moro fishermen visit the reefs, where the boats are
anchored. Provided only with a short, heavy knife, with which to
release the shells from the bottom or, perchance, as a weapon of
defense against sharks and other fish, they enter the water feet first,
but soon turn and descend head downward, precisely as on the Australian
coast, swimming toward the bottom with bold strokes. The
Sulu pearl-divers—and especially those at Parang, Patian and Sicubun—are
among the most expert in the world. They easily penetrate
to twelve fathoms and, if necessary, to eighteen or twenty fathoms.
But they are not very industrious, and seldom descend more than
twelve or fifteen times a day, preferring rather to go with their wants
half satisfied than to satiate them by more active exertions.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many descents may be necessary to locate and obtain a single oyster,
but when this is secured the shell alone may ordinarily be traded for
sufficient to supply the fisherman’s needs for several days, and there
is always the chance of a pearl. After a short day of labor, the fishermen
return, and the oysters which they have secured are opened and
examined for pearls. After the flesh has been carefully searched it is
placed in the sun to dry and, later, to be used for food, and the shells
are carefully cleaned and placed under cover until they may be bartered
or sold.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Sulu shell is characterized by a peculiar yellowish tint around
the rim, by means of which it is readily distinguished. Its size and
beautiful iridescence make it very attractive, and for choice individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>specimens high prices are received. It is the largest of the mother-of-pearl
shells, single half-shells of “bold” size average one and one
half pounds in weight, while some attain a weight of six pounds. The
body of the shell furnishes the most beautiful of all mother-of-pearl,
yet the necessity for discarding the yellow rim, or, rather, for using it
separate from the rest, makes it unpopular with manufacturers. The
annual product is estimated at 200 tons, valued in London and New
York at $200,000, and of pearls about $30,000 worth.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Sulu pearls are frequently large and of choice quality, but they
are far more inclined to a yellowish tint than those from Australian
waters, 1300 miles southward. The sultans accumulated the finest collection
of them, and some of these found their way into the markets
from time to time as the condition of the exchequer ran low or royal
emergency required, as in 1882, for instance, when it was necessary to
defray the expense of Sultan Buderoodin’s pilgrimage to Mecca. During
the last six or seven years, much has been heard of the present
sultan’s collection, which he largely inherited, and some fairly good
specimens have been presented to prominent Americans.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearl-oysters are among the important resources of the inshore waters
of the Dutch East Indies, including the surrounding seas of Sumatra,
Java, Borneo, Celebes, the Aru Islands, the Moluccas or Spice
Islands, and Papua or New Guinea. For very many years the natives
have gathered pearl shell and pearls from these waters, and especially
on the coast of the Aru Islands, at Gilolo or Halmahera, and the islands
thereabout, on the east coast of Celebes, and about the Sunda group.
The collections were made in the shallow waters by beach-combing and
by nude diving, and were bartered with the Chinese and Arab traders
sailing from Singapore, Macassar, and other ports. Occasionally a
pearling vessel from Singapore or from Torres Straits would try its
luck in these waters; but, except for the work of the natives, the reefs
were practically untouched previous to 1883.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the Australian fleet increased in size and the oysters became
scarce in Torres Straits and on the northwest coast, some of the vessels
occasionally visited the Aru Islands, the coast of Papua, etc. These
met with considerable success and the number of trips increased, especially
in 1893, when oysters were unusually scarce in Australia.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following year, 1894, the government restricted the fishery to
inhabitants of the Netherlands and of Netherlands India, or to companies
established in those countries and operating under the Dutch
flag. Owing to the activity of Dutch capital in coffee, tobacco and
other plantation enterprises, the pearl resources received very little attention
from them. The success of the Australian fishery encouraged
the formation in 1896 of an Amsterdam company to exploit the Aru
grounds; but apparently without financial success, for it liquidated in
1898.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>In the meantime, residents of these islands paid more and more attention
to the pearl fishery; also Europeans, Chinamen and Arabs
arranged with the native chiefs for fishing in their territorial waters,
paying therefor a fixed sum in cash or a percentage of the catch, which
was permitted on approval by the governor-general of Dutch India.
The fleet continued to increase from year to year, and in 1905 there
was a very large influx of vessels from the Australian fisheries, 110
luggers and 7 tenders coming from Thursday Island alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>The species are the same as occur on the northern coast of Australia,
the “silver edge” or “golden lip” (<i>Margaritifera maxima</i>) occurring
in greatest abundance, and the “black lip” (<i>M. margaritifera</i>) to a less
extent.</p>

<p class='c013'>The shells are the principal object of the search, and the pearls found
incidentally form an additional source of revenue. These shells divide
with those of Australia the reputation of being the most valuable in
the world. They are commonly known in the trade by the name of the
port from which they are originally shipped, as Manila, Macassar,
Banda, Ceram, Penang, Mergui, etc. Before the exploitation of the
Australian grounds, they sold at very high prices, and $2000 or more
per ton was sometimes realized for those of the best quality. Singapore
is the headquarters for supplies for the industry in all this region,
and it is from that port that the shells and pearls are mostly distributed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearls obtained in Netherlands India are of choice quality and
of relatively large size, a considerable percentage of them weighing
over eight grains, and fairly good pearls of fifty grains or more are
occasionally reported. Colored pearls are rarely met with, nearly all
of them being clear white, like the beautiful Macassar shell.</p>

<p class='c013'>At Pados Bay, island of Borneo, one hundred or more persons find
employment fishing the Placuna oysters, selling the shells for about
$2 per picul (139 pounds to the picul), the dried meats at $4 to $6 a
picul, and the seed-pearls (<i>seleesip</i>) at about $2 per mayam. Many
of these pearls are sold in the village of Batu Batu. When a fisherman
buys his few necessaries at the Chinese shops, he pulls out his little
package of seed-pearls and pays in that currency, the Chinaman making
a good profit by the transaction.</p>

      <div class='line'>Extract from Columbus’s Fourth Letter.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>The Caribbean Sea furnishes one of the most interesting chapters
in the history of the pearl fisheries. In no region of the
world have these resources caused more rapid exploitation or
affected the inhabitants to a greater extent than on the shores
of Venezuela.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before the discovery of America, the natives of this region collected
pearls from the mollusks which they opened for food in times of
necessity, and also sought them for ornamental purposes. And although
they had large collections which they used for personal ornamentation
and for decorating their temples, it does not appear that
they prized them extravagantly, readily bartering them for small
returns.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Columbus’s account of his third and fourth voyages to America,
he repeatedly refers to pearls. On the third voyage, in 1498, after
passing the mouth of the Orinoco River, he entered the Gulf of Paria,
where the natives “came to the ship in their canoes in countless numbers,
many of them wearing pieces of gold on their breasts, and some
with bracelets of pearls on their arms; seeing this I was much delighted
and made many inquiries with the view of learning where they found
them. They replied that they were to be procured in their own neighborhood
and also at a spot to the northward of that place. I would
have remained here, but the provisions of corn, and wine, and meats,
which I had brought out with so much care for the people whom I had
left behind, were nearly wasted, so that all my anxiety was to get them
into a place of safety, and not to stop for anything. I wished, however,
to get some of the pearls that I had seen, and with that view
sent the boats on shore. I inquired there also where the pearls were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>obtained. And they likewise directed me to the westward and also to
the north behind the country they occupied. I did not put this information
to the test, on account of the provisions and the weakness of
my eyes and because the ship was not calculated for such an undertaking.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In his letter to one of the queen’s attendants, written in 1500,
Columbus says, in justification of his conduct toward his miserable
detractors: “I believed that the voyage to Paria would in some degree
pacify them because of the pearls and the discovery of gold in the
island of Española. I left orders for the people to fish for pearls, and
called them together and made an agreement that I should return for
them, and I was given to understand that the supply would be abundant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And again in the same letter, after speaking of a quantity of gold
which mysteriously disappeared when Governor Bobadilla sent him
and his brothers loaded with chains to Spain, he says: “I have been yet
more concerned respecting the affair of the pearls, that I have not
brought them to their Majesties.... Already the road is opened to
gold and pearls, and it may surely be hoped that precious stones,
spices, and a thousand other things will also be found.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A more detailed account of Columbus’s pearling adventures, and of
the subsequent discoveries and explorations on the Caribbean coast is
given by Francisco Lopez de Gomara in his “Historia general de las
Indias,” published in 1554, of which the following is a literal translation
slightly abridged:</p>

<p class='c020'>Since there are pearls on more than four hundred leagues of this coast
between Cape Vela and the Gulf of Paria, before we proceed farther it is
proper to say who discovered them. In the third voyage made by Christopher
Columbus to the Indies, in 1498, having reached the island of Cubagua, which
he called “Isle of Pearls,” he sent a boat with certain sailors to seize a boat of
fishermen, to learn what people they were and for what they were fishing.
The sailors reached the shore where the Indians had landed and were watching.
A sailor broke a dish of Malaga ware and went to trade with them and
to look at their catch, because he saw a woman with a string of rough pearls
(<i>aljofar</i>) on her neck. He made an exchange of the plate for some strings of
rough pearls, white and large, with which the sailors returned highly delighted
to the ships. To assure himself better, Columbus ordered others to go with
buttons, needles, scissors, and fragments of the same Valencian earthenware,
since they seemed to prize it. These sailors went and brought back more
than six marcs (forty-eight ounces) of rough pearls, large and small, with
many good pearls among them. Said Columbus then to the Spaniards: “We
are in the richest country of the world. Let us give thanks to the Lord.”
They wondered at seeing all those rough pearls so large, for they had never
seen so many, and could not contain their delight. They understood that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Indians did not care much for the small ones, either because they had plenty
of large ones, or because they did not know how to pierce them.</p>

<p class='c020'>Columbus left the island and approached the land, where many people had
collected along the shore, to see if they also had pearls. The shore was covered
with men, women, and children, who came to look at the ships, a strange
thing for them. Many Indians presently visited the ships, went on board and
stood amazed at the dress, swords, and beards of the Spaniards, and the
cannon, tackle, and arms of the ship. Our people crossed themselves, and
were delighted to see that all those Indians wore pearls on their necks and
wrists. Columbus asked by signs where they fished them, and they pointed
to the coast and island.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Venezuela and Panama; the principal pearling regions of South America</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Columbus then sent to the shore two boats with many Spaniards, for
greater certainty of those new riches, and because they importuned him.
The chief took them to a place where there was a circular building that resembled
a temple, where presently much bread and fruits of different kinds
were brought. At the end of the feast he gave them pearls for sweetmeats,
and took them afterward to the palace to see the women and the arrangement
of the house. Of the numerous women there, not one was without rings of
gold and necklaces of pearls. The Spaniards returned to the ships, wandering
at such pearls and gold, and requested Columbus to leave them there.
But he did not wish to do so, saying they were too few to settle. He hoisted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>sail and ran along the coast as far as Cape Vela, and from there came to Santo
Domingo, with the intention of returning to Cubagua after regulating the
affairs of the government. He suppressed the joy he felt at having found
such treasures, and did not write to the king regarding the discovery of
pearls, or at all events did not write it until it was already known in Castile.
This was largely the cause for the anger of the king, and the order to bring
Columbus a prisoner to Spain. They say that he did not so much intend to
conceal this discovery from the king, who has many eyes, as that he thought
by a new agreement to get this rich island for himself.</p>

<p class='c020'>Of the sailors who went with Christopher Columbus when he found the
pearls, the greater number were from Palos. As soon as these came to
Spain, they told about the country of pearls, displayed many, and carried them
to Seville to sell, whence they went to the court and into the palace. Excited
by this report, some persons there hurriedly prepared a ship and made Pedro
Alonso Niño its captain. He had from the Catholic king license to go in
search of pearls and land, provided he should not go within fifty leagues
of any discovered by Columbus.</p>

<p class='c020'>Niño embarked in August, 1499, with thirty-three companions, some of
whom had been with Columbus. He sailed as far as Paria, visited the coast
of Cumana, Maracapan, Port Plechado, and Curiana, which lies united to
Venezuela. There he landed, and a chief, who came to the coast with fifty
Indians, conducted him amicably to a large town to take water, refreshments,
and the barter he was in search of. He bartered for and secured fifteen
ounces of pearls in exchange for pins, rings of horn and tin, glass beads,
small bells, and similar trifles. The Spaniards stayed in the town twenty
days, trading for pearls. The natives gave a pigeon for a needle, a turtledove
for one glass bead, a pheasant for two, and a turkey for four. For that
price they also gave rabbits and quarters of deer. The Indians asked to be
shown the use of needles, since they went naked and could not sew, and were
told to extract the thorns with them, for they went barefooted: Niño brought
to Galicia ninety-six pounds of rough pearls, among which were many fine,
round, lustrous ones of five and six carats, and some of more. But they were
not well pierced, which was a great fault. On the route a quarrel arose over
the division, and certain sailors accused Niño before the governor in Galicia,
saying that he had stolen many pearls and cheated the king in his fifth, and
traded in Cumana and other places where Columbus had been. The governor
seized Niño, but did not keep him in prison very long, where he consumed
pearls enough.<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c017'><sup>[270]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>This expedition of Pedro Alonso Niño was the first financially profitable
voyage to America. After his return, the Cubagua pearl fishery
became the object of numerous speculations, and many other Spaniards
fitted out voyages, most of them sailing from Hispaniola or Haiti,
nine hundred miles distant. Owing to the ill-treatment of the Indians
and excessive cruelties toward them, much difficulty was experienced
in securing divers. This was relieved in 1508 by transporting large
numbers of Indians from the Lucayan or Bahama Islands and impressing
them into the service. These were so expert in the work that
individuals sold for upward of 150 ducats each.<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c017'><sup>[271]</sup></a> With their aid the
fishery prospered so greatly that in 1515 a settlement, called New
Cadiz, was established on Cubagua Island by the governor of Hispaniola,
Diego Columbus, son of the discoverer. This small island was
dry and desolate, without water or wood, which were brought from
the mainland twenty miles distant, or from Margarita Island about
three miles to the northward.</p>

<p class='c013'>An interesting description of the manner of securing the pearls by
these early adventurers was given by Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo
y Valdes (1478–1557) in his “Historia natural y general de las Indias,”
written less than thirty years after the discovery of the mainland
of America. A translation of this book was published in 1555
by Richard Eden in his “Decades of the New World”; from which
we extract the following account, the retention of Eden’s quaint
phraseology seeming permissible owing to this being one of the very
earliest books on America.</p>

<h3 class='c031'><i>Of the maner of fyshynge for perles</i></h3>

<p class='c038'>The Indians exercise this kynde of fyschynge for the moste parte in the
coastes of the North in <i>Cubagua</i> and <i>Cumana</i>. And manye of theym which
dwell in the houses of certeyne particular lordes in the Ilandes of <i>San Dominico</i>
and <i>Sancti Iohannis</i>, resort to the Ilande of <i>Cubagua</i> for this purpose.
Theyr custome is to go fyve, syxe, or seven, or more in one of theyr <i>Canoas</i>
or barkes erly in the mornynge to sume place in the sea there about where it
appeareth unto them that there shulde bee greate plentie of those shell fyshes
(which sume caule muscles and sume oysters) wherein perles are engendered.
And there they plonge them selves under the water, even unto the bottome,
savynge one that remaynethe in the Canoa or boate which he keepeth styll in
one place as neare as he can, lookynge for theyr returne owte of the water.
And when one of them hath byn a good whyle under the water, he ryseth up
and commeth swymmynge to the boate, enterynge into the same, and leavynge
there all the oysters whiche he hath taken and brought with hym. For
in these, are the perles founde. And when he hathe there rested hym selfe a
whyle, and eaten parte of the oysters, he returneth ageyne to the water, where
he remaynethe as longe as he can endure, and then ryseth ageyne, and swimmeth
to the boate with his pray, where he resteth hym as before, and thus
continueth course by course, as doo all the other in lyke maner, being all moste
experte swymmers and dyvers. And when the nyght draweth neare, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>returne to the Ilande to theyr houses, and presente all the oysters to the master
or stewarde of the house of theyr lorde who hath charge of the sayde Indians.
And when he hath gyven them sumwhat to eate, he layeth up the
oysters in safe custodie untyll he have a great quantitie thereof. Then hee
causeth the same fyssher men to open them. And they fynde in every of
them pearles other great or smaul, two or three or foure, and sumtymes five
and syxe, and many smaule graines accordyng to the lyberalitie of nature.
They save the pearles bothe smaule and great whiche they have founde: And
eyther eate the oysters if they wyl, or caste them away, havynge so great
quantitie thereof that they in maner abhorre them. Those oysters are of
hard fleshe, and not so pleasant in eatyng as are owres of Spayne. This
Ilande of <i>Cubagua</i> where this manner of fysching is exercised, is in the Northe
coaste, and is no bygger then the Iland of Zelande. Oftentymes the sea encreaseth
greatly, and muche more then the fyshers for pearles wold, bycause
where as the place is very depe, a man can not naturally rest at the bottome
by reason of the aboundaunce of aery substannce whiche is in hym, as I have
oftentymes proved. For althoughe he may by vyolence and force descende
to the bottome, yet are his feete lyfted up ageyne so that he can continue no
tyme there. And therefore where the sea is verye deepe, these Indian fyshers
use to tye two great stoones aboute them with a corde, on every side one, by
the weyght whereof they descend to the bottome and remayne there untyl
them lysteth to ryse ageine: At which tyme they unlose the stones, and ryse
uppe at their pleasure. But this their aptenesse and agilitie in swimming, is not
the thynge that causeth men moste to marvaile: But rather to consyder how
many of them can stande in the bottome of the water for the space of one
hole houre and summe more or lesse, accordynge as one is more apte hereunto
then an other. An other thynge there is whiche seemeth to me very straunge.
And this is, that where as I have oftentymes demaunded of summe of these
lordes of the Indians, if the place where they accustomed to fysche for pearles
beynge but lyttle and narrowe wyll not in shorte tyme bee utterly without
oysters if they consume them so faste, they al answered me, that although
they be consumed in one parte, yet if they go a fyschynge in an other parte
or on another coaste of the Ilande, or at an other contrary wynd, and continue
fysshing there also untyll the oysters be lykewyse consumed, and then returne
ageyne to the fyrste place, or any other place where they fysshed before
and emptied the same in lyke maner, they find them ageine as ful of oysters
as though they had never bin fysshed. Wherby we may judge that these
oysters eyther remove from one place to an other as do other fysshes, or elles
that they are engendered and encrease in certeyne ordinaire places. This
Iland of <i>Cumana</i> and <i>Cubagua</i> where they fyshe for these perles, is in the
twelfe degree of the part of the said coaste which inclineth toward the
North.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cupidity of the proprietors of the fishery led to most cruel treatment
of the divers and, if the accounts of the time are to be relied
upon, a large percentage of them died under the harsh regime. About
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>1515 the unfortunate natives obtained an earnest and influential advocate
in Bartolomé de las Casas, who, in 1516, prevailed upon the
youthful Charles V to decree that the fishery should be prosecuted
only in summer, that the divers should not be required to work more
than four hours a day where the depth exceeded six fathoms, that they
should receive good nourishment and half a quart of wine daily,
should have hammocks or beds in which to sleep, and should be provided
with clothes to put on as soon as they left the water.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c017'><sup>[272]</sup></a> And by
later ordinances it was stipulated that death should be inflicted on any
one forcing a free Indian to dive for pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1528 the resources of Coche Island were exploited with so much
success that within six months “1500 marcs (12,000 ounces) of pearls”
were secured. Pearl banks were successively found at Porlamar,
Maracapana, Curiano, and at various places on the coast from the
Gulf of Paria to the Gulf of Coro, a distance of over five hundred
miles, which became designated the “Pearl Coast.” For a number of
years previous to 1530, the output exceeded in value 800,000 piastres
annually, approximating one half the produce of the American mines
at that time.<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c017'><sup>[273]</sup></a> It was largely these pearls that enriched the cargoes of
many of those famous caravels that crossed the Atlantic to Spain. Indeed,
for several decades, America was best known in continental
Europe as the land whence the pearls came.</p>

<p class='c013'>An interesting account of an early effort to use dredges in the
Cubagua pearl fishery was given by Girolamo Benzoni, who had lived
in America from 1542 to 1555, and was familiar with the conditions.
He states:</p>

<p class='c020'>“At the time the pearl fishery flourished on this island there came here one
Louis de Lampugnan with an imperial license authorizing him to fish such
quantities of pearls as he pleased within all the limits and bounds of Cubagua.
This man set out from Spain with four caravels loaded with all the necessary
provisions and munitions for such an enterprise, which some Spanish merchants
furnished him. He had made a kind of rake, the fashion of which was
such that in whatever part of the sea it was used, not an oyster would escape.
At the same time he would have raked and drawn out all that bore pearls if
he had not been disappointed. But the Spaniards in Cubagua all banded
against him in the execution of his privilege. They said the emperor was too
liberal with other people’s goods, and if he wished to give he might give his
own as he wished. As for themselves they had conquered and kept that country
with great labor and at the peril of their lives, and there were far better
reasons why they should enjoy it than a stranger. Poor Lampugnan, seeing
that his patents did not avail him the value of a straw, and at the same time
not daring to return to Spain, partly through fear of being ridiculed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>partly on account of the money he owed, was ruined. In fact, the business and
its anxieties drove him crazy and he was exposed to the mockery of all the
world as a lunatic. In the end, after dragging out five years in this miserable
condition, he died in this isle of Cubagua.”<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c017'><sup>[274]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The average size of these pearls derived from the Venezuelan fisheries
was small, specimens rarely exceeding twenty grains. In 1577,
Urbain Chauveton wrote: “The pearls of Cubagua are mostly 2, 3, 4,
and 5 carats. But the quantity of them is so great that the fifth part
which is paid to the king of Spain yields every year the value of more
than 15,000 ducats; this besides the frauds committed and the pearls
which stick to the fingers of those who manage the business, and who
pilfer the most beautiful in great numbers, sending them here and
there for sale. They place themselves in great danger if the facts become
known, but they do it all the same.”<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c017'><sup>[275]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The enormous demands made by the Spaniards soon had its effect
on the resources, for Chauveton adds: “It is apparent they decrease
and not so many are found as in the beginning. The reason for this
is that the Spaniards are so eager to gather large quantities of them
quickly that they are not content to use their divers to search for them
in the depths of the sea, but they have conceived and invented I know
not how many machines of rakes and drags to scrape up everything.
In fact they have at times collected them all so that another could not
be found, and have had to abandon their fishing for a considerable time
to give the oysters a chance to lay their eggs and grow their pearls.”<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c017'><sup>[276]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The decrease noted by Chauveton was probably not very serious,
for the Spanish historian, Jose de Acosta, reports that in 1581 he saw
“the note of what came from the Indies for the king; there were 18
marcs of pearles, besides 3 caskets; and for private persons there were
1265 marcs, and besides them, 7 caskets not pierced, which heretofore
we would have esteemed and helde for a lie.”<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c017'><sup>[277]</sup></a> Also the records show
that in 1597 Spain received from the Venezuelan fisheries “350
pounds’ weight of pearls.” It is to be regretted that the Spaniards so
frequently reported the yield of pearls by pounds’ weight, for—owing
to the great variation in quality—this is about as unsatisfactory as to
report the wealth of an individual by the pounds’ weight of his title-deeds
or of his stock certificates. The value of “350 pounds of pearls”
might have been anywhere from twenty thousand dollars to as many
millions. Assuming that all were two grains each in weight and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>good quality, the total value would approximate $600,000 according
to the valuation of that period; and on a basis of eight grains each, it
would be $9,600,000, or sixteen times as much. But as original parcels
of pearls from the fisheries, these figures should be divided by three.</p>

<p class='c013'>Following 1597, the productiveness of the Cubagua beds rapidly
decreased. By acts of cruelty and oppression the Spaniards had converted
the surviving Indians into deadly foes, ready to take advantage
of any opportunity to avenge themselves on their oppressors, and thus
terrifying the settlers into abandoning the enterprise. Early in the
seventeenth century the development of mining resources in Mexico,
Peru, etc., attracted the adventurous Spaniards. A considerable decrease
in the value of pearls, brought about by the skilful manufacture
of imitations at Venice, and elsewhere in southern Europe, also affected
the prosperity of the fisheries. As a result of these combined influences,
the output in Venezuela was greatly reduced, and it ceased
long before the close of the following century. Thus ended an enterprise
which, for a number of years, represented the greatest single
industry of the European people on the American continent.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to General Manuel Laudecta Rosales, the Venezuela
archives contain no reference to any renewal of the fishery until early
in the nineteenth century. At the time of Humboldt’s visit in 1799,
the fishery was entirely neglected around the islands of Margarita,
Cubagua, and Coche, and the only evidence of pearls was a few very
insignificant ones picked up about Cumana and sold among the natives
at a piaster per dozen.<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c017'><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>After the overthrow of Spanish authority on this coast, Messrs.
Rundell, Bridge and Rundell, a firm of well-known goldsmiths of London,
obtained, in 1823, from the government of Colombia, a ten-year
monopoly of the fishery at several places on the coast of the new
republic, in consideration of one fifth of the pearls secured.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c017'><sup>[279]</sup></a> After the
independence of Venezuela in 1829, the taxes imposed were so heavy
that the industry languished, and about 1833 it was practically abandoned.</p>

<p class='c013'>Owing to the improved physical condition of the reefs, the fishery
developed largely in 1845; and for several years an average of 1600
ounces of pearls were secured, an ounce of good quality selling for
150 to 500 bolivars (one bolivar = 19½ cents), and the inferior
quality at 80 to 100 bolivars.<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c017'><sup>[280]</sup></a> At that time there was a tax of sixteen
bolivars per boat monthly. In 1853 this was increased to forty-eight
bolivars per boat, and the use of dredges (<i>arrastras</i>) was interdicted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>soon reducing the fishery to a very low stage. Subjected to frequent
changes in regulations, and burdened by heavy taxes, the industry
remained in poor condition until about 1895. Since then the enhanced
value of pearls, and the increased industrial activity on the coast, has
resulted in a very large development of the fishery.</p>

<p class='c013'>In recent years the government of Venezuela has granted concessions
to individuals and to companies for the exploitation of defined
areas for a limited period, exacting 10 per cent. royalty on the proceeds
of the enterprise. In granting these concessions, the government
usually reserves the right to examine the books, and to intervene
when necessary in any phase of the enterprise. For protecting its
revenue, the government requires that shipments of the pearls must
be signed by its agent, and bills of sale must be countersigned by the
Venezuelan consul in the place where the sales are consummated.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Venezuelan pearl fishery now gives employment to about 350
boats, manned by five or six men each, sailing from the ports of Juan
Griego, Cumana, and Carupano. These are sail craft, measuring
from two to fifteen tons each, and are licensed by the Venezuelan
authorities at a charge of 15 bolivars ($2.92) each. Most of the boats
use dredges, but some of them resort to nude diving, after the manner
of the sixteenth century. Attempts have been made to use the scaphander,
or diving armor, but without success, owing largely to the
difficulty in obtaining experienced workmen, and also to local prejudice
against this form of fishery. It is claimed that in using the scaphander,
all oysters are removed from the reefs, whereas the <i>arrastra</i>
or dredge spreads the oysters and thereby enlarges the reefs. This is
the principal and, except those at Sharks Bay and the Sulu Islands,
the only important pearl fishery in which the oysters are secured by
means of dredges. These are made of iron and are similar to those
implements used in the scallop fisheries of New York and Rhode
Island. They are dragged over the beds, and when filled are lifted
and their contents emptied into the boat, the fishermen culling out the
desirable oysters from the mass and throwing the refuse material
overboard.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearl-oyster (<i>Margaritifera radiata</i>) secured on the coast of
Venezuela is closely related to the Ceylon species. It averages slightly
larger in size, and there is a much greater range in coloration. The
pearls are of good quality. In color they range from white to bronze,
and occasionally a so-called black one is found. The total output is
valued locally at about 1,750,000 francs ($350,000) per year. Most
of them are sold in Paris.</p>

<p class='c013'>Owing to their small size and lack of thickness, the shells of the
Venezuela pearl-oyster are of little or no value in the mother-of-pearl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>trade. Thousands of tons of them, the accumulations of scores of fisheries,
lie in heaps and ridges along the coast, as though in years long
past vast armies of oysters, engaged in deadly combat, had left their
innumerable myriads of slain comrades to bleach on the shores.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the point of view of the Spaniards of his day, the greatest result
of Balboa’s immortal journey in 1513 across the Isthmus of Panama
to the broad waters of the Pacific, was the discovery of the pearl
resources of the Gulf of St. Michael, now known as the Gulf of
Panama. Probably the best description of this is given by Lopez de
Gomara in his “Historia general de las Indias,” published in 1554,
from which we translate the following account.</p>

<p class='c013'>After Balboa had reached the Pacific in 1513, he proceeded a short<a id='t235'></a>
distance along the coast until he met with an Indian chief by the name
of Tomaco. Being questioned about the gold and pearls which some of
his people wore, Tomaco sent for some gold and 240 large pearls and
a great number of small ones—a rich present, which filled the Spaniards
with pleasure. Seeing the Spaniards so delighted, Tomaco ordered
some of his men to go and fish for pearls. These went and in a
few days obtained 64 ounces, which also he gave them. The
Spaniards were surprised to see such pearls, and that their owners did
not value them; they not only gave them away, but their paddles were
decorated therewith, for the principal income and wealth of these chiefs
was the pearl fishery. Tomaco told Balboa that these riches were nothing
in comparison with those of Tararequi, which had pearls larger
than a man’s eye, taken from oysters the size of sombreros. The
Spaniards wished to go there at once, but fearing another tempest,
left it for their return. They dismissed Tomaco and rested
in the country of Chiape, who, at the request of Balboa, sent thirty
of his men to fish. These did it in the presence of seven Spaniards,
who looked on and saw them take six loads of small shells. As it
was not the season for that fishery, they did not go into very deep
water where the shells were. Not only did they not fish in September
and the following months, but they did not even travel by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>water, on account of the stormy weather which then prevails in that
sea. The pearls which they extracted from those shells were like
peas, but very fine and white. Of those received from Tomaco, some
were black, others green, blue, and yellow.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the return of Balboa’s expedition to Darien in 1514, the sight of
the pearls and the wonderful reports made by the men, caused his
successor, Pedrarias, to fit out another expedition, an account of
which we likewise translate from Gomara.</p>

<p class='c020'>By command of Pedrarias, Gaspar de Morales went in the year 1515 to
the Gulf of St. Michael, with 550 Spaniards, in quest of the island of Tararequi,
which was said by Balboa’s men to be so abundant in pearls and so near
the coast. The chief of that island sallied forth with many people to prevent
his entrance, and clamored and fought three times with our people on equal
terms, but the fourth time he was defeated. He then made friends, carried
the chief of the Spaniards to his house, which was a large and good one, gave
him food to eat, and a basket of pearls which weighed 110 marcs [880
ounces]. The chief received for them some looking-glasses, stringed beads,
bells, scissors, axes, and small wares of barter, which he valued more than he
had the pearls. He promised to give as tribute to the emperor, in whose
guardianship he placed himself, 100 marcs of pearls every year. With these
the Spaniards returned to the Gulf of St. Michael and from thence to Darien.</p>

<p class='c020'>Tararequi is within five degrees of the equator. It possessed a great fishery
for pearls, which are the largest and best of the new world. Many of the
pearls which the cacique gave were like filberts, others like nutmegs, and there
was one of 26 and another of 31 carats, pear-shaped, very lustrous, and most
perfect, which Peter of the Port, a shop-keeper, bought of Gaspar de Morales
for 12,000 castilians. The purchaser could not sleep that night for thinking on
the fact that he had given so much money for one stone, and so he sold it the
very next day to Pedrarias de Avila, for his wife Donna Isabel de Bovadilla, at
the same price, and afterwards the Bovadilla sold it to Donna Isabella the
Empress.</p>

<p class='c020'>Pedrarias, who delighted in such fishery, requested the cacique to make
his men fish for pearls in the presence of the Spaniards. The fishermen were
great swimmers and divers, and seemed to have spent all their lives in that
employment. They went in small boats when the sea was calm, and not in
any other manner. They cast a stone for an anchor from each canoe, tied by
strong, flexible withes like boughs of the hazel. They plunged to search for
oysters each with a sack or bag at the neck, and returned loaded with them.
They entered four, six, and even ten fathoms of water, for the shell is larger
the deeper they go, and if at times the larger ones come in shallow water it is
through storms, or because they go from one place to another in search for
food, and having found their pasture they stay there until they have finished it.
They perceive those who search for them, and stick so close to the rocks or
ground, or one to another, that much strength is needed to detach them, and
many times the fishermen cannot raise them and leave them, thinking they are
stones. In this fishery many persons are drowned, either by remaining too
long at the bottom, or because they become entwined or entangled in the cord,
or such carnivorous fish as the shark devour them. This is the manner of
fishing pearls in all the Indies, and many fishermen die from the dangers
aforesaid, and from the excessive and constant labor, the little food, and the
maltreatment they have. The emperor was led to enact a law among those
whom Blasco Nunez Vela brought, which imposed the penalty of death upon
him who should forcibly compel any free Indian to fish for pearls. He thought
more of the lives of the men than of his interest in pearls, though they were
of great value. The law was worthy of such a prince and of perpetual memory.<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c017'><sup>[281]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Gonzalo de Oviedo referred to the pearl resources of Panama in his
“Historia natural de las Indias,” Toledo, 1526, mentioned in the chapter
on pearl fisheries of Venezuela. After describing the resources of
Cubagua and Cumana on the Venezuelan coast, he states, according
to Eden’s quaint translation:</p>

<p class='c020'>Lykewise pearles are founde and gathered in the South sea cauled <i>mare
del sur</i>. And the pearles of this sea [the Caribbean coast] are verye bygge.
Yet not so bigge as they of the Ilande of pearles cauled <i>de las perlas</i>, or <i>Margaritea</i>,
whiche the Indians caule <i>Terarequi</i>, lying in the gulfe of saincte
Michael, where greater pearles are founde and of greater price then in any
other coaste of the Northe sea, in <i>Cumana</i>, or any other porte. I speake this
as a trewe testimonie of syght, havyng byn longe in that South sea, and makynge
curious inquisition to bee certenly informed of all that perteyneth to the
fysshvnge of perles. From this Ilande of Tararequi, there was brought a
pearle of the fasshyon of a peare, wayinge xxxi carattes, which Petrus Arias
had amonge a thousande and soo many poundes weight of other pearles which
hee had when capitayne Gaspar Morales (before Petrus Arias) passed to the
saide Ilande in the yeare 1515, which pearle was of great prise. From the
saide Ilande also, came a great and verye rounde pearle, whiche I brought owte
of the sea. This was as bygge as a smaule pellet of a stone bowe, and of the
weight of xxvi carattes. I boughte it in the citie of Panama in the sea of Sur:
and paide for it syxe hundredth and fyftie tymes the weyght therof of good
gold,<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c017'><sup>[282]</sup></a> and had it thre yeares in my custodie: and after my returne into Spaine,
soulde it to the erle of Nansao, Marquisse of Zenete, great chamberleyne to
youre maiestie, who gave it to the Marquesse his wyfe, the ladye Mentia of
Mendozza. I thyncke verely that this pearle was the greatest, fayrest, and
roundest that hath byn seene in those partes. For youre maiestie owght to
understande that in the coaste of the sea of Sur, there are founde a hundredth
great pearles rounde after the fasshyon of peare, to one that is perfectly
rounde and greate. This Iland of Terarequi which the Christians caule the
Ilande of pearles, and other caule it the Ilande of floures, is founde in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>eyght degree on the southe syde of the firme lande in the provynce of golden
Castyle or Beragua. (Arber, “The First Three English Books on America,”
Birmingham, 1885.)</p>

<p class='c013'>In addition to the gems noted by Oviedo, these waters furnished
many other beautiful pearls in the sixteenth century, and added largely
to the collections of the Spanish court and of the cathedrals of Seville,
Toledo, etc. The Italian traveler, Gemelli-Careri, who visited the
Panama fisheries in 1697, reported that they yielded pearls equal to
those of Ceylon. He mentioned one weighing 60 grains, for which
the owner—a Jesuit priest—refused 70,000 pesos.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c017'><sup>[283]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In 1735, the Spanish admiral, Antonio de Ulloa visited the Panama
pearl fisheries and wrote an extended description of them.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c017'><sup>[284]</sup></a> According
to his account the pearls were then found in such plenty that there
were few slaveholders in the vicinity who did not employ at least a
portion of their Negroes in the fishery. These were selected for their
dexterity in diving, and were sent to the islands in gangs of from eight
to twenty men each, under the command of an overseer. They lived
in temporary huts on the shore, and visited the pearl reefs in small
boats. Anchoring in eight or ten fathoms of water, the Negroes would,
dive in succession to the bottom, returning with as many oysters as
possible. It was laborious work, attended with danger owing to the
numerous sharks.</p>

<p class='c020'>Every one of these Negro divers is obliged daily to deliver to his master
a fixed number of pearls; so that when they have got the requisite number of
oysters in their bag, they begin to open them, and deliver the pearls to the
officer, till they have made up the number due to their master; and if the pearl
be but formed, it is sufficient, without any regard to its being small or faulty.
The remainder, however large or beautiful, are the Negro’s own property,
nor has the master the least claim to them, the slaves being allowed to sell
them to whom they please, though the master generally purchases them at a
very small price.... Some of these pearls, though indeed but few, are sent
to Europe, the greater part being carried to Lima, where the demand for them
is very great, being not only universally worn there by all persons of rank,
but also sent from thence to the inland portions of Peru.<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c017'><sup>[285]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>During the hundred years following, the pearl reefs of Panama were
not very productive, and relatively little attention was paid to them.
The development of a market for the shells in the mother-of-pearl
trade, about 1840, enhanced the profits of the few natives engaged in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>pearling in a desultory manner, and led to an increase in the number
of fishermen. During some years when industrial and market conditions
were favorable, large quantities of shells were exported. In
1855, for instance, 650 tons of these shells were shipped to England
alone, and in 1859 the reported quantity was 957 tons. Those from
the Island of San José, one of the Pearl Archipelago, were said to be
the largest and choicest in the bay. Many of them were used in decorating
the twin towers of the stately old cathedral at Panama.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since then the industry has fluctuated greatly, depending on the
market for the shell. Many outsiders have experimented in the fishery,
but most of these attempts have resulted in financial loss, through
mismanagement, storms, sickness, or other causes. A story is told
locally of a party of thirty men, principally from Scotland, who arrived
at Panama equipped with a diving-bell and such necessary machinery
as air-pumps, windlasses, etc. Much was expected of their
operations, but soon yellow fever broke out among them, and within
six weeks two thirds of the members of the party had died. The remaining
members, becoming disheartened, and in fear of the dread
disease, lost no time in leaving the country. The diving-bell and machinery
remained for several years as a curiosity at Panama, for no
one returned to claim them, nor has the use of similar apparatus been
attempted since then.</p>

<p class='c013'>The scattered pearl reefs extend from the east side of the Bay of
Panama nearly to the Costa Rica boundary. However, this gives an
exaggerated idea of their area, as much of this territory yields no
pearl-oysters whatever. The principal reefs and the headquarters of
the fishery are at Archipelago de las Perlas or Pearl Islands, which
are from thirty to sixty miles southeast of the Pacific terminus of the
projected Panama Canal. This archipelago contains sixteen small
islands, on which are about twice that number of small settlements of
Negro and Indian descendants, with a total population of perhaps one
thousand. About half of these live on Isla del Rey, the largest island,
about fifteen miles long and half that in width. The chief village, San
Miguel, is the center of the pearling industry, and consists mostly of
palm-thatched huts and a handsome stone church, more costly than
all the remaining buildings of the town combined. While the soil is
fertile and some vegetables are raised, the inhabitants depend almost
wholly on the fisheries.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1901, the Republic of Colombia invited bids for the right to
operate the pearl and coral fisheries for a term of fifteen years, but
nothing seems to have come of it, and the establishment of the
Panama Republic in 1903 terminated the authority of Colombia in
these resources.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>The Panama fisheries differ widely in their character from those of
Venezuela. The mollusk is much larger, averaging about six inches
in diameter when fully grown, thus furnishing a valuable quality of
mother-of-pearl. The shell constitutes the principal object of the
fishery; the pearls themselves are of incidental importance, but are
always looked for and anxiously expected.</p>

<p class='c013'>The season extends from May to November, with a rest during the
remaining five months of the year. The fishery is open to natives and
to foreigners alike. While the leading fishermen employ diving-suits,
which were introduced here about 1890, nude diving is yet practised
to a considerable extent, the men descending in eight or ten, and some
even in twelve fathoms of water. There is no restriction whatever on
the nude fishermen, but for each machine diver an annual license fee
of $125 United States currency is exacted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Owing to the low market price for Panama shell during recent
years, the fishery has not been vigorously prosecuted, and it has even
dwindled to low proportions. A letter from one of the leading pearling
companies in Panama states that the machine divers number
about twenty, while there are about four hundred nude fishermen;
and another firm likewise prominent, estimates these fishermen at
twenty and three hundred respectively.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet a third pearling company writes that there are fifteen machine
divers and two hundred head divers; and adds that the small demand
for this quality of mother-of-pearl has made the condition of the industry
about as bad as it could be; many who have capital invested
are getting out of the business, and unless the market improves, the
industry may be abandoned. Probably with the introduction of new
capital and methods in the infant republic, the pearl resources may
receive greater attention and a large development ensue.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Panama pearls are of good quality and frequently of large
size. In color they range from white to green and lead-gray, and
frequently greenish black. Valuable pearls are not common, but occasionally
the fisherman is amply rewarded. A letter from the American
consul at Panama states that in 1899 a native boy, fifteen years
old, fishing in shallow water, as much for sport as for profit, found a
pearl which he sold to a local speculator for 4000 silver dollars
($1760); this speculator delivered the same pearl to a dealer in
Panama for 10,000 silver dollars ($4400), and an offer of 30,000
francs was refused for it later in Paris. A pearl worth $2400 was
reported as found within half a mile of the steamship anchorage at
Panama. A pearl from a giant oyster resembling Tridacna, was an
absolute egg-shape, pure cocoanut white, and weighed 169 grains; it
was 21 mm. at the longest and 16.5 mm. at the narrowest part. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>surface showed very distinctly a wavy structure, occasionally with a
tiny, brighter central point; the surface under the glass resembling a
honeycomb network. At the smallest point there was a radiated center
with quite a brilliant field. It was worth only $100.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not always, however, does the poor, ignorant fisherman receive the
full value of his find; and many a story is told of some thoughtless
improvident native, who, for less than a mess of pottage, “like the
base Indian, threw a pearl away, richer than half his tribe.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Most of the Panama pearls are sold in Paris, relatively few of them
coming to America direct. This is not because of any greater estimation
of them in Paris or higher prices obtained; but the trade relation
has been long continued and the credits are well established. From
Paris many of these pearls reach the American market.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearl-bearing oysters are found at various places on the Pacific
coast of Mexico, and especially along the coast of Lower California,
where extensive fisheries are prosecuted. The pearls are noted for
the great variety of colors which they display. A large percentage
are black, others are white, brown, peacock green, etc. Generally they
are small and of irregular form, yet sometimes very large ones are
secured, weighing 100, 200, and even 300 grains.</p>

<p class='c013'>European knowledge of the pearl resources of Mexico dates from
the conquest of that country by Hernando Cortés about 1522. The
diary of his lieutenant, Fortuno Ximines, tells of finding native chiefs
living in primitive huts along the sea-shore, with quantities of beautiful
pearls lying carelessly around. From a tribe near the present site of
Hermosillo, in the State of Sonora, Cortés secured great quantities of
the gems. It appeared that the fishery had been in existence for centuries.
The location of the pearl reefs was prominently noted on
Cortés’ map of this coast, made in 1535, a copy of which was procured
by the Rev. Edward E. Hale when in Spain in 1883.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>Following Cortés’ explorations of the Pacific coast of Mexico
(1533–1538), a number of expeditions were fitted out for securing
pearls by trading with the natives, by forcing them to fish, and by
even more questionable means. Several of these expeditions found
record in history either by reason of their unusual success or through
the extreme cruelty with which they were conducted. The contact of
the Spaniards with the Indians resulted in very bitter feelings on the
part of the latter, so that it became risky for small traders to venture
among them. From time to time, successful expeditions were made,
especially the one of 200 men sent in 1596 by the viceroy of Mexico
to “the rich Isles of California,” mentioned by Teixeira.<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c017'><sup>[286]</sup></a> Antonio
de Castillo, a Spanish colonist, with headquarters south of Mazatlan,
was one of the most successful of the early adventurers, and Iturbide
Ortega and José Carborel were also among the fortunate ones of
that period.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c017'><sup>[287]</sup></a> Ortega marketed his pearls in the city of Mexico, and
the reported sale of one for 4500 dollars had considerable effect in
stimulating the industry.</p>

<p class='c013'>The advent of the Jesuits to western Mexico in 1642, developed
amicable relations with the Indians; and although the missionaries
were agriculturists rather than fishermen, the restoration of harmony
resulted in a more favorable prosecution of the fisheries. The colonists
of Sinaloa and Nueva Galicia, who had formerly, in small
vessels and with great danger, made occasional visits to the pearl
beds, built larger vessels and made more frequent visits without apprehension.
The skilful Yaqui and Mayo Indians were employed or
impressed as divers, just as natives of the Bahamas had served in
the fisheries of Venezuela. Great profits resulted from the operations.
Venegas wrote that “it was certain that the fifth of every vessel was
yearly farmed for 12,000 dollars.”<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c017'><sup>[288]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>So profitable was the fishery that the Spanish soldiers and sailors
stationed in the Gulf of Cortes—as the Gulf of California was then
called—were frequently charged with devoting more attention to
pearling than to their official duties. In order to put a stop to this
evil, in 1704, Father Silva-Tierra, who was in authority in that part
of the country, ordered that no soldier or sailor should engage in the
fishery. With a view to removing the demoralizing influences of
promiscuous adventurers among the Indians, the industry was later
restricted to persons specially authorized.</p>

<p class='c013'>Probably the most successful of the early pearlers was Manuel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Osio, who is credited with having marketed “127 pounds’ weight of
pearls in 1743,” and “275 pounds’ weight” in 1744.<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c017'><sup>[289]</sup></a> He operated in
the vicinity of Mulege and northward, employing the Yaqui Indians;
and through his pearling interests is said to have become the richest
man in Lower California.</p>

<p class='c013'>The revenue from the royal fifth, somewhat later, was reported by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Alvarado<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c017'><sup>[290]</sup></a> at 12,000 dollars per year; but this was disputed by Jacob
Baegert, a Jesuit priest. Baegert spent seventeen years in Mexico and,
returning to Europe on the expulsion of his order from that country in
1767, published a report in 1772, containing rather an unfavorable
view of the fishery. He stated that each summer eight, ten, or twelve
poor Spaniards from Sonora, Sinaloa, and elsewhere on the mainland,
crossed the gulf in small boats to the California shore for the purpose
of obtaining pearls. They carried supplies of Indian corn and dried
beef, and also a number of Indians who served as divers, the Spaniards
themselves showing little inclination to engage in the work when
native fishermen could be employed so cheaply. Provided with a sack
for receiving the oysters which they removed from the bottom, the
fishermen dived head first into the sea, and when they could no longer
hold their breath they ascended with the gathered treasure. The
oysters were counted before opening; and, when the law was complied
with, every fifth one was put aside for the king’s revenue. Most of
the oysters yielded no pearls; some contained black pearls, others white
ones, the latter usually small and ill-shaped. If, after six or eight
weeks of hard labor and deducting all expenses, a Spaniard gained a
hundred American pesos, he thought he had made a little fortune,
but this he could not do every season. “God knows,” said Baegert,
“whether a fifth of the pearls secured in the California sea yields to
the Catholic king an average of 150 or 200 pesos in a year, even without
frauds in the transaction. I heard of only two persons—with
whom also I was personally acquainted—who had accumulated some
wealth, after spending 20 or more years in the business. The others
remained poor notwithstanding their pearl fishing.”<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c017'><sup>[291]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Father Baegert’s statement of the returns seems to be substantiated
by the reports of the royal fifth a few years later. For the period from
1792 to 1796 this was placed at “2 lbs. 2 ozs.” by some writers; and
according to others, from 1788 to 1797 it amounted to only “3 lbs.
9 ozs.,” which is the quantity assigned by some accounts to 1797 alone.<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c017'><sup>[292]</sup></a>
These returns apparently indicate that a great decrease had occurred
since the days of Osio; but it seems very doubtful whether, under the
conditions existing in Mexico at that time, the royal treasury received
its due share of the proceeds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly following the independence of Mexico in 1821, and after
a period of little activity, several attempts were made to exploit the
pearl resources. The great prosperity in England, ensuing upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>termination of the Napoleonic Wars, resulted in much speculation and
the promotion of stock subscriptions in many visionary schemes.
Among these was “The General Pearl and Coral-Fishing Association
of London,” which in 1825 equipped and sent out to Mexico, by way
of Cape Horn, two vessels prepared to exploit the pearl resources by
the use of diving-bells similar to those formerly employed in submarine
construction. This expedition was under the direction of
Lieutenant R. W. H. Hardy, whose report thereon presents an interesting
exhibit of the condition of the pearl fishery at that time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hardy found the fishery at a very low ebb, owing, largely, to the
scarcity of oysters and the uncertainty of depending on the native
divers. He adds with peculiar naïveté: “I had almost forgotten to
mention a very curious circumstance with respect to the pearl-oyster,
namely that on the coast of Sonora there are none at all, except at
Guaymas.” He states also that to the northward of 28° 30′ not the
trace of a shell could be discovered on either side of the gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>The center of the industry was then at Loreto, a village of 250 inhabitants;
but another small station existed at La Paz. At Loreto
six or eight vessels of twenty-five tons each were employed, each having
three or four sailors and fifteen or twenty Yaqui Indians who
served as divers. Head-diving was in vogue, the work proceeding
from 11 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> to 2 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, and the depth ranging from three to twelve
fathoms. The annual catch of pearls was “4 or 5 pounds’ weight,
worth from $8000 to $10,000.”<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c017'><sup>[293]</sup></a> After the government’s claim of
one fifth had been set apart, the owner and captain of the vessel received
one half and the divers the other half.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was found impossible to use diving-bells when the sea was at all
rough, and even during calm weather they were impracticable on account
of the unevenness of the ground and the strong undercurrents.
An effort was made to employ native divers, but owing to the disorganized
state of affairs only four could be secured. In the Gulf of
Mulege a large number of oysters were collected, but when these were
opened “six very small pearls” were all that could be found. After
spending about three years on the coast, Hardy returned to England,
and the company abandoned the enterprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the early history of the Mexican pearl fishery, the shells were of
no market value; but about 1830 a French trader named Combier made
experimental shipments to France, securing cheap freight rates by
using the waste shells largely as ballast for the vessels.<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c017'><sup>[294]</sup></a> The best
quality sold for about 600 francs per ton, and the market was found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>sufficient for regular shipments. The value gradually increased, and in
1854 it approximated 2000 francs per ton in France, placing the industry
upon a very remunerative basis. This resulted in much activity
in the fishery, and an increase in the number of boats and divers.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1855, the fishery gave employment to 368 divers, and yielded
$23,800 worth of pearls, and 350 tons of shells worth $13,500.<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c017'><sup>[295]</sup></a> It was
estimated by Lassepas that from 1580 to 1857, inclusive, 95,000 tons of
oysters were removed from the Gulf of California, yielding 2770
pounds of pearls, worth $5,540,000.<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c017'><sup>[296]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>For protection of the reefs, the Mexican government in 1857 divided
the Gulf of California into four pearling districts, and provided that
only one of them should be worked each year, and then only in areas
leased for the season to the highest bidders, thereby permitting the
reefs successively to remain undisturbed for three years.</p>

<p class='c013'>The yield of pearls in 1868 approximated $55,000, and that of shells
$10,600 in value; while in 1869 these items were given as $62,000 and
$25,000, respectively.<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c017'><sup>[297]</sup></a> The local prices ranged from $15 per ounce
for seed-pearls to $1500 for a choice gem.</p>

<p class='c013'>At that period the fishery was carried on from shore camps or from
large vessels, each carrying twenty to fifty divers, who were mostly
Yaqui Indians from the eastern shore of the gulf. The camp or vessel
was located in the vicinity of the reefs or beds, and the fishing was
prosecuted from small boats, each carrying three or four nude divers.
Fastened to the waist or suspended from the neck was a net for the
reception of oysters, and each diver carried a short spud or stick with
which to detach them from the bottom, and to some extent for use as
a weapon of defense against sharks and similar enemies. The diving
progressed mostly in the morning, when the sea was unruffled by the
breeze which usually begins shortly after noon. The season lasted
from May to late in September, when the water became too cold for
further operations.</p>

<p class='c013'>The divers were paid a definite share of the catch, and kept in debt-bondage
by means of advances and supplies. Little clothing was necessary,
and the provisions consisted principally of corn, beans, and sun-dried
beef. Luxuries were added in the form of tobacco, and of mescal
distilled from the maguey plant, indulgence in these constituting the
chief remuneration for the season’s labor. The finding of an unusually
choice pearl brought to the lucky fisherman a gratuity of a few
dollars, and shore leave for several days in which to spend it. Dressing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>in his best calico garments, he hastened to the nearest town to indulge
in release from restraint, in drunkenness and debauchery—the
highest dreams of happiness of a Yaqui Indian—thoughts of which
served to bring him to the fishery each year from his home across the
gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the Spanish conquest until 1874, the Mexican pearl fishery
was conducted exclusively by nude divers. The experiments with the
diving-bell in 1825 had been without favorable result, and also an
attempt by an American in 1854 to use a diving-suit with air-pump,
etc., this failure being credited to imperfection of apparatus. In 1874,
through the influence of European pearl merchants, two schooners,
each of about 200 tons’ measurement, one from Australia and the
other from England, visited the Mexican grounds, with a dozen boats
fully equipped with scaphanders or diving armor, including helmets,
rubber suits, pumps, etc. Owing to their working in deeper water
than the nude divers were able to exploit, their success was remarkable,
and they secured upward of a hundred thousand dollars’ worth
of pearls and shells during the first season.</p>

<p class='c013'>The hitherto somnolent inhabitants of Lower California were
amazed at seeing their resources thus easily removed, and were
awakened to the opportunities afforded them to acquire the wealth
which nature had scattered at their very doors. With this object-lesson
before them, companies were formed for raising sufficient
capital for the business, and the leading operators equipped their men
with scaphanders, to the great annoyance of the would-be independent
fishermen, who had not sufficient means to purchase the costly equipment.
Many of these continued to employ nude divers, but after 1880
this method of fishery was subordinate to the use of diving apparatus.
The change was accompanied by many accidents, and rarely did a
month pass without the loss of a man, due in most cases to faulty
apparatus or to inexperienced management.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1884 President Gonzalez inaugurated the policy of granting exclusive
concessions to the pearl reefs. On February 28 of that year,
five concessions were granted to as many persons, giving them and
their associates and assigns the exclusive right to all shell fisheries in
their respective zones of large area, for a period of sixteen years,
in consideration of a royalty and export duty, amounting altogether to
about $10 per ton of shells exported in the first three years, and $15
per ton for the remaining thirteen years of the term. Immediately
these five grants were consolidated, forming the Lower California
Pearl Fishing Company (“Compañia Perlífera de la Baja California”),
incorporated under the laws of California with an invested
capital of $100,000.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Other concessions were given covering the ocean shore of Lower
California, the eastern side of the gulf within the States of Sonora and
Sinaloa, and the ocean shore of Mexico southward from Sinaloa. In
addition to these, certain territorial rights of fishing are claimed
through grants dating back very early in the history of the country.
So eagerly have these concessions been sought in recent years, that
there is now little pearling ground on the coast which is not under
corporate or private claim. And, owing to speculation in these concessions
and in the formation of companies to develop them, it is somewhat
difficult to obtain wholly reliable data relative to the condition
and extent of the industry.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two species of pearl-bearing mollusks occur on the Mexican coast.
The principal one is the <i>M. margaritifera mazatlanica</i>, known locally
as the <i>concha de perla fina</i>. This species is closely related to the “black
lip shell” of the Australian coast. It is considerably larger than the
Venezuelan oyster, averaging four or five inches in diameter and attaining
an extreme diameter of seven or possibly eight inches. It
occurs to some extent all along the Pacific coast of Mexico, in detached
beds intercalated in places. The principal reefs, which have been exploited
for nearly four centuries, are in the shallow waters of the
Gulf of California and especially within the 300 miles between Cape
San Lucas and Mulege Bay. The fisheries have centered about the
islands of Cerralvo, Espiritu Santo, Carmen, and San José, and in the
bays of Mulege, Ventana, and San Lorenzo. The depth of water on the
reefs ranges from two to twenty-five fathoms, with an average of
probably six or eight fathoms. The species is generally isolated, and
firmly attached by the byssus to the bottom rocks or the stone corals,
from which it may remove in case of necessity, though it probably does
not do so frequently.</p>

<p class='c013'>The second species is known locally under the name <i>concha nacar</i>,
and has been named <i>Margaritifera</i> (<i>Avicula</i>) <i>vinesi</i> (Rochebonne).<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c017'><sup>[298]</sup></a>
It occurs only in the northern part of the gulf near the mouth of the
Colorado River. Formerly it was abundant in that region, occurring
in large areas, but it has become much reduced and is now little
sought after. It is claimed that this species is far more productive of
pearls than the <i>M. margaritifera</i>, and that it yielded the large quantities
obtained by Osio in the eighteenth century. Although iridescent,
the shell is so thin and convex that it is without commercial value.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>The headquarters of the Mexican pearl fishery are at La Paz, the
capital of Lower California, 240 miles northwest of Mazatlan and 150
miles north of Cape San Lucas. This “Mantle of Peace”—the literal
translation of La Paz—contains about 5000 inhabitants, nearly all of
whom are more or less dependent on the pearl fishery. It presents an
attractive picture, with the cocoanut-palms extending down almost to
the water’s edge, and the high mountains forming a background. The
low, stone houses, the tile roofs, the plaza with tropical trees, and the
beautiful flower beds under perennial sunny skies, give it a quaint appearance.
The most conspicuous objects from the harbor are the large
old warehouses, with thick walls and iron-barred windows, for the
storage of the pearls and the shells. During the season, from April to
November, the arrival and departure of the pearling vessels presents a
scene of great animation.</p>

<p class='c013'>The present methods of the fishery on the Mexican coast are quite
different from those of thirty years ago when nude diving was the only
method in vogue. Instead of the haphazard work, largely in shallow
water, the industry is conducted systematically, and the limit of depth
is increased, much of the diving being in depths of ten to fifteen
fathoms. The fishermen operate either from a large vessel making a
cruise two or three months in length, or from a camp on the shore near
the reefs. A vessel visits them frequently to furnish supplies and to
transport the catch to La Paz. The fishing boats are undecked craft,
each equipped with an air-pump and a crew of six men: a diver, a <i>cabo
de vida</i> or life-line man, who is usually the captain, two <i>bomberos</i> at
the air-pump, and two rowers.</p>

<p class='c013'>The greatest depth at which armored diving is attempted in Mexico
rarely exceeds twenty fathoms; twenty-five fathoms is fully as deep as
it is practicable to go, and it is not advisable to remain at that depth
more than a very few minutes. At fifteen fathoms a diver may remain
half an hour or more, and at six or eight fathoms he may work uninterruptedly
for several hours. When the water is very cold, the diver
comes up frequently to restore his numbed circulation by vigorous
rubbing. The occupation is especially conducive to rheumatism, and
paralysis is more or less general, due, not only to the compressed atmosphere,
but to the abrupt changes of temperature. The work is very
debilitating, with particular effect on the nerves, and partial deafness
is common. It is important that the diver be careful about overeating
before descending, as heavy foods, and meats especially, make respiration
difficult; therefore, breakfast consists of little more than bread
and coffee. The risks and dangers from sharks, devil-fish, etc., have
greatly diminished since the introduction of scaphanders; for a stout
diver in his waterproof dress, with leads on the breast, shoulders, and
shoes, and on his head a massive helmet containing great gaping windows
for eyes, is enough to cause even a hungry shark to hesitate and
to seek a more digestible meal.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are yet many nude divers in Mexico, who operate in shallow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>waters, their cheap labor making them successful competitors of the
armored divers. In arranging with these, the pearling company commonly
grub-stakes a crew, pays a stipulated sum per hundredweight
for the shells, and bargains for the pearls. If the fishermen are not
satisfied with the price offered for these, they are at liberty to sell to
other buyers under certain restrictions.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nude diving is confined to the warm months, beginning about the
middle of May and continuing until October. Owing to the cloudy or
muddy condition of the water in the gulf, the nude diver can not inspect
the bottom from the surface and select the best oysters before
descending, nor can he work satisfactorily at depths greater than seven
or eight fathoms. While the work is hard, it is more remunerative
than the average branch of labor in this region.</p>

<p class='c013'>Each day the boats deliver their catch of oysters at the fishing-camps
or on board the receiving vessels. After they have been freed from
marine growths and refuse, the mollusks are opened and searched for
pearls. This operation is performed by trusted employees, usually
elderly men who have become physically disqualified for diving, and
who, seated together at a low table, work under the watchful eyes of
overseers. A knife is introduced between the valves of the oyster, the
adductor muscle is severed, and the valves are separated by breaking
the hinge. The animal is removed from the shell and carefully examined
with the eyes and the fingers, and then squeezed in the hands to
locate any pearl which may be concealed in the organs or tissues. The
debris is passed to other persons, who submit it to further examinations.
A man may work all day long and find only a few seed-pearls,
but occasionally there is the excitement of discovering a beautiful gem.</p>

<p class='c013'>In some localities the flesh of the pearl-oyster is a source of profit
through its sale to Chinamen, who dry and otherwise prepare it for
sale among their countrymen in Mexico and America, as well as in the
Orient. Frequently the large adductor muscle is dried for food, making
excellent soup-stock, and, indeed, it is quite palatable when stewed.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is difficult to approximate the output of the Mexican pearl fisheries,
other than the pearl shell, because the dealers place a merely
nominal value on the pearls in their invoices when sending them to
Europe, an invoice of $500 sometimes representing gems valued in
Paris at several thousand dollars. Furthermore, it is difficult to obtain
satisfactory information from the pearling companies, owing,
presumably, to the fear of developing greater competition. According
to the estimates at La Paz, the local value of the pearl yield
now approximates $250,000 annually, and the value of the same over
the counters in Europe and America probably exceeds one million
dollars.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Some remarkably large pearls have been secured in the Mexican
fisheries, especially considering the small size of the oysters. In 1871
a pearl of 96 grains, pear-shaped and without a flaw, sold at La
Paz for 3000 pesos. In March, 1907, a beautiful pinkish white one,
found near the lower end of the peninsula, sold for 28,000 pesos or
$14,000. One of the best years for choice finds was 1881, when the
scaphanders were first employed to their greatest efficiency. A black
pearl was then secured which weighed 112 grains, and which brought
40,000  francs in Paris. In 1882 two, weighing 124 and 180 grains
respectively, sold for 11,000 pesos. In the following year a light brown
pearl, flecked with dark brown, and weighing 260 grains, sold for 7500
pesos. These are the prices which the La Paz merchants received for
these pearls, and not the much greater amounts for which they were
finally sold by the jewelers.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the finest pearls was found in 1884 near Mulege. This
weighed 372 grains. The Indian fisherman is said to have sold it for
$90; the purchaser declined an offer of 1000 pesos, and also a second
offer of 5000, and soon sold it to a La Paz dealer for 10,000 pesos. Its
value in Paris was estimated at 85,000 francs. Probably the most
famous of all pearls obtained from these grounds was “the 400–grain
pearl” found near Loreto, and “which is now among the royal jewels
of Spain.” It is said that this was offered by the lucky fisherman to
the Mission of Loreto, and by the Director of Missions in Lower California
was presented to the Queen of Spain.<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c017'><sup>[299]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>As in every other fishery, one hears in Mexico of fishermen who
have grasped a prize only to lose it through inexperience or improvidence.
The account given above of the sale of the 372–grain pearl
found near Mulege furnishes an instance of this. It is related in La
Paz that in 1883 an Indian sold for ten pesos a gem weighing 128
grains, for which the purchaser received 27,500 francs in Paris. On
another occasion a Mexican sold two pearls, easily worth $4000, for
$16 worth of groceries.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the eighteenth century, the Notre Dame de Loreto possessed a
remarkable collection of Mexican pearls, which had been presented
from time to time by the fishermen. During the régime of the Jesuits,
it was customary to devote the proceeds of the last day of the fishery
to the decoration of the altar of that mission. After the expulsion of
this religious order in 1767, the mission was pillaged and the collection
dissipated. From the old aristocracy of Mexico, family heirlooms of
many choice pearls were placed on the European market during the civil
wars in Mexico to contribute to the support of the contending armies.
One lady in Sonora is said to have disposed of her collection for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>550,000  francs. A fine collection of these pearls, accumulated from
1760 to 1850, and showing them in a great variety of colors, shapes,
and sizes, was in Chihuahua until recently.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most recently developed pearl fisheries are within the limits of the
United States, in the rivers and fresh-water lakes, and especially those
in the Mississippi Valley. As an important industrial enterprise, these
fisheries are less than two decades old, yet they are very productive,
yielding annually above half a million dollars’ worth of pearls, many
of which compare favorably in quality with those from oriental seas.</p>

<p class='c013'>The prehistoric mounds in the Mississippi Valley present evidence
of the estimation in which pearls were held by a race of men who
passed away ages before America was first visited by Europeans. In
some of these mounds, erected by a long-forgotten race, pearls have
been found not only in hundreds and in thousands, but by gallons and
even by bushels. Some of these equal three quarters of an inch in
diameter, and in quantity exceed the richest individual collections of
the present day. Damaged and partly decomposed by heat and
through centuries of burial, they have lost their beauty, and are of
value only to the archæologist and to indicate the quantity of pearly
treasures possessed by these early people.</p>

<p class='c013'>Owing to the great wealth of pearls which had been uncovered on
the Spanish Main, at Panama, and in the Gulf of California, Eldorado
explorers, in the sixteenth century, were particularly eager in
searching for them within the present limits of the United States; in
the reports of their wanderings, much space is given to these gems,
and these reports aided largely in inducing and encouraging other expeditions.
Some of these accounts read like the marvelous stories of
Sindbad the Sailor, quantities of pearls—hundreds of pounds in some
instances—being secured by the exchange of trinkets and by more
questionable means. It would be easy to bring together numerous
accounts of apparently reliable authorities to show that in the sixteenth
century pearls were obtained here in far greater quantities than
were ever known in any other part of the world; but this conclusion
seems not wholly correct.</p>

<p class='c013'>The unfortunate wanderings of Hernando de Soto from 1539 to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>1542 gave rise to most of the reports of rich pearl finds within the limits
of this country. Of this voyage there are three principal accounts.
The first was by Luis Hernandez de Biedma, who had accompanied De
Soto as factor for Charles V of Spain. His brief report was presented
to the king in 1544, although it was not published until 1841, nearly
three centuries later, when it appeared in a French translation.<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c017'><sup>[300]</sup></a> The
second, and in our opinion the most reliable account,<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c017'><sup>[301]</sup></a> published at
Evora in 1577, was by an unnamed Portuguese (in English editions,
commonly spoken of as the Gentleman of Elvas), who was a member
of the expedition. The third account,<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c017'><sup>[302]</sup></a> by far the longest and most
widely known, but which was not written until 1591, was by Garcilasso
de la Vega, who represented that his information was from a Spanish
cavalier who had accompanied De Soto.</p>

<p class='c013'>The only reference made to pearls in Biedma’s report seems to be
his allusion to the large quantity secured at the village of Cofaciqui, on
the east bank of the Savannah River. He states: “When we arrived
there, the queen&nbsp;... presented the governor with a necklace of pearls
of five or six rows, procured for us canoes to pass the river, and assigned
the half of the village for our quarters. After having been in
our company three or four days, she escaped into the forest; the governor
caused search to be made after her, but without success; he then
gave orders to break open a temple erected in this village, wherein the
chiefs of the country were interred. We took out of it a vast quantity
of pearls, which might amount to six or seven arrobas,<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c017'><sup>[303]</sup></a> but they were
spoiled by having been underground.”<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c017'><sup>[304]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The Portuguese narrative alludes to the pearls at Cofaciqui, stating
that the queen “took from her own neck a great cordon of pearls, and
cast it about the neck of the governor.... And the lady, perceiving
that the Christians esteemed the pearls, advised the governor
to search certain graves in the town, where he would find many; and
that if he would send to the abandoned towns, he might load all his
horses. He sought the graves of that town and there found fourteen
rows of pearls, and little babies and birds made of them.”<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c017'><sup>[305]</sup></a>
This account makes no further mention of pearls, except to state
that at the battle of Mavilla this great collection was burned, and
that when the Queen of Cofaciqui escaped from the Portuguese she carried
with her a little chest full of unbored pearls, which some of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Spaniards thought were of great value;<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c017'><sup>[306]</sup></a> and further, that on one or
two other occasions a few pearls were received from the Indians as
presents.</p>

<p class='c013'>The account of De Soto’s wanderings, given by Garcilasso, the
Peruvian historian, contains many references to pearls, which read
more like romance than reality. With his knowledge of the jewels,
temples, etc., in Mexico and Peru, and recognizing some similarities
in the manners of the people of those countries and the ones
with whom De Soto came in contact, Garcilasso was easily led to statements
which, though possibly true in the one case, seem fictitious in
the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>He gives the story of the Queen of Cofaciqui, with some additional
particulars. The string of pearls which she presented to the governor
made three circuits of her neck and descended to her waist. In his
account, the graves in Cofaciqui became a temple containing, among
other riches, more than a thousand measures of pearls, of which they
took only two. Near Cofaciqui was the temple of Talomeco, over a
hundred steps long by forty broad, with the walls high in proportion.
Upon the roof of the temple were shells of different sizes, placed with
the inside out, to give more brilliancy, and with the intervals “filled
with many strings of pearls of divers sizes, in the form of festoons,
from one shell to the other, and extending from the top of the roof
to the bottom.” Within the temple, festoons of pearls hung from the
ceiling and from all other parts of the building. In the middle were
three rows of chests of graded sizes, arranged in pyramids of five or
six chests each, according to their sizes. “All these chests were filled
with pearls, in such a manner that the largest contain the largest
pearls, and thus, in succession, to the smallest, which were full of
seed-pearls only. The quantity of pearls was such, that the Spaniards
avowed, that even if there had been more than nine hundred men and
three hundred horses, they all together could not have carried off at
one time all the pearls of this temple. We ought not to be too much
astonished at this, if we consider that the Indians of the province conveyed
into these chests, during many ages, all the pearls which they
found, without retaining a single one of them.”<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c017'><sup>[307]</sup></a> In the armory attached
to this temple were long pikes, maces, clubs, and other weapons
mounted with links and tassels of pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Garcilasso has an interesting story of an incident said to have occurred
a few days after leaving Cofaciqui, when the troops were passing
through the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Juan Terron, one of the stoutest soldiers of the army, toward noon, drew
from his saddle-bags about six pounds of pearls, and pressed a cavalier, one of
his friends, to take them. The cavalier thanked him and told him that he
ought to keep them, or rather, since the report was current that the general
would send to Havana, send them there to buy horses and go no longer afoot.
Offended at this answer, Terron replied that “these pearls then shall not go any
farther,” and thereupon scattered them here and there upon the grass and
through the bushes. They were surprised at this folly, for the pearls were as
large as hazel-nuts, and of very fine water, and because they were not pierced
they were worth more than six thousand ducats. They collected about thirty
of these pearls, which were so beautiful that it made them regret the loss of the
others, and say, in raillery, these words, which passed into a proverb with
them, “There are no pearls for Juan Terron.”<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c017'><sup>[308]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>At the capital of Iciaha, De Soto received from the cacique or chief,
a string, five feet in length, of beautiful and well-matched pearls as
large as filberts. Upon De Soto’s expressing a desire to learn how the
gems were extracted from the shells, the chief immediately ordered
four boats to fish all night and return in the morning.</p>

<p class='c020'>In the meantime they burnt a great deal of wood upon the shore, in order
to make there a great bed of live coals, that at the return of the boats they
might put thereon the shells, which would open with the heat. They found, at
the opening of the first shells, ten or twelve pearls of the size of a pea, which
they took to the cacique, and to the general who was present, and who found
them very beautiful, except that the fire had deprived them of a part of their
lustre. When the general had seen what he wished, he returned to dine; and
immediately after, a soldier entered, who instantly said to him that, in eating
oysters which the Indians had caught, his teeth had encountered a very beautiful
pearl of a very lively color, and that he begged him to receive it to send to
the governess of Cuba. Soto politely refused this pearl, and assured the
soldier that he was as obliged to him as if he had accepted it; and that some
day he would try to acknowledge his kindness, and the honor which he did his
wife; and that he should preserve it to purchase horses at Havana. The
Spaniards valued it at four hundred ducats; and as they had not made use of
fire to extract it, it had not lost any of its lustre.<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c017'><sup>[309]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Notwithstanding the strong indorsement given to Garcilasso’s narrative
by Theodore Irving and some other writers, his tendency to
exaggerate depreciates greatly the historical value of his account, and
it seems wholly unreliable as an authority relative to early resources
in America. We may reasonably doubt whether De Soto’s expedition
came in contact with more pearls than those mentioned by Biedma and
the Portuguese writer.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>The account of the first voyage along the coast of the United
States, that of the Italian, Juan Verrazano, in 1524, contains no reference
to pearls, although he penetrated into the interior a score or two
of miles, and was frequently in contact with the natives, who lived
largely by fishing, and who prized many ornaments of different colored
stones, copper rings, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first expedition which went far into the interior was the ill-fated
one under command of Pánfilo de Narvaez in 1528. A thrilling
account<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c017'><sup>[310]</sup></a> of this journey was written by Cabeza de Vaca, who was one
of the four survivors, after eight years’ wandering through America
to Mexico. Cabeza had been controller and royal treasurer of the
expedition, and in that position it was his particular duty to acquaint
himself with all the pearls, gold, and similar riches found by the party.
Notwithstanding his tradings with the Indians and their efforts to
gain his friendship by means of presents, his account makes no mention
of pearls, except to refer to a statement made by some Indians
that on the coast of the South Sea there were pearls and great riches.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hernando D’Escalante Fontaneda, who was shipwrecked on the
Florida coast about 1550, and was detained there a prisoner for seventeen
years, wrote:</p>

<p class='c020'>“Between Abolachi [Appalachicola] and Olagale is a river which the Indians
call Guasaca-Esqui, which means Reed River. It is on the sea-coast, and
at the mouth of this river the pearls are found in oysters and other shells;
from thence they are carried into all the provinces and villages of Florida.”<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c017'><sup>[311]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The European narrators also reported great stores of pearls along
the Atlantic seaboard. Among the first of these may be mentioned
David Ingram, who is represented as traveling by land from the
Gulf of Mexico to the vicinity of Cape Breton in the years 1568 and
1569. As it appeared in the first edition of Hakluyt’s Voyages, this
relation states:</p>

<p class='c020'>“There is in some of those Countreys great abundance of Pearle, for in
every Cottage he founde Pearle, in some howse a quarte, in some a pottel [half
a gallon], in some a pecke, more or less, where he did see some as great as an
Acorn; and Richard Browne, one of his Companyons, found one of these
great Pearls in one of their Canoes, or Boates, wch Pearls he gave to Mouns
Campaine, whoe toke them aboarde his shippe.”<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c017'><sup>[312]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Estimation of Ingram’s wonderful relation is decreased by Purchas’s
comment:</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>As for David Ingram’s perambulations to the north parts, Master Hakluyt,
in his first edition printed the same; but it seemeth some incredibilities of his
reports caused him to leave him out in the next impression; the reward of
lying being, not to be believed in truths.<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c017'><sup>[313]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Even the members of Raleigh’s Roanoke Colony of 1585 reported
pearls. Hariot stated:</p>

<p class='c020'>Sometimes in feeding on Muscles we found some Pearle: but it was our
happe to meet with ragges, or of a pide colour: not having yet discovered
those places where we heard of better and more plenty. One of our company,
a man of skill in such matters, had gathered from among the Savage people
about five thousand: of which number he chooses so many as made a faire
chaine, which for their likenesse and uniformity in roundenesse, orientnesse,
and piednesse of many excellent colours, with equality in greatnesse, were very
faire and rare: and had therefore been presented to her Majesty, had we not by
casualty, and through extremity of a storme lost them, with many things els
in coming away from the countrey.<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c017'><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>So far as we can learn, there is no evidence to show that, during the
sixteenth or the seventeenth century, any pearls of value were received
in Europe from within the present limits of the United States,
as was the case with the resources of Venezuela, Panama and Mexico.
Many of the accounts quoted above seem wholly fictitious, some of
them possibly drawn up for the purpose of promoting exploring expeditions.
It is also probable that knowledge of the enormous collections
at Venezuela and Panama misled some of the narrators into recognizing
as pearls the spherical pieces of shell or even the cylindrical wampum
which the Indians made in large quantities and used as money.</p>

<p class='c013'>However, it is unquestionable that pearls of value were in the possession
of some of the wealthier tribes. Biedma’s account of the 150
pounds or more of damaged pearls in the graves at Cofaciqui seems
wholly reliable, and likewise many other statements; and it is an interesting
problem to determine the source from which the Indians obtained
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Most of the narratives refer to the pearls as coming from the coast
of the South Sea or Gulf of Mexico. The evidence of Fontaneda, who
had spent seventeen years in the country, throws some light on this.
He states that pearls were obtained at the mouth of Reed River near
Appalachicola, whence they were distributed throughout Florida.
This seems to indicate that on the west coast of Florida there might
have been extensive reefs of pearl-bearing mollusks, which have since
become extinct, although existing shell-heaps do not confirm this.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>While it is possible and even probable that many of these pearls in
the possession of the Indians came from the Gulf of Mexico or even
from the Caribbean Sea, it seems much more likely that they came
largely from the Unios of the inland lakes and rivers.</p>

<p class='c013'>The voyages of Narvaez, Ayllon, De Soto, Ribault, etc., had been
so unfortunate that for a century little exploration was made in the
territory of the southern part of the United States. When this territory
was again invaded, little was seen in the way of pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Iberville, who established the French settlement near the mouth of
the Mississippi in 1699, was specially directed to look for them. His
instructions state: “Although the pearls presented to his Majesty are
not fine either in water or shape, they must nevertheless be carefully
sought, as better may be found, and his Majesty desires M. d’Iberville
to bring all he can; ascertain where the fishery is carried on, and see
it in operation.”<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c017'><sup>[315]</sup></a> Pearls were found in the territory of the Pascagoulas,
but they were not worth the trouble of securing them. It appears
that from these the Pearl River in Mississippi derived its name.</p>

<p class='c013'>The only reference to pearls in the seventy-one volumes of Travels
and Explorations of the Jesuit Missionaries in New France, from 1610
to 1791, is a note by Father Gravier stating that he saw no choice
pearls: “It is true the chief’s wife has some small pearls; but they are
neither round nor well pierced, with the exception of seven or eight,
which are as large as small peas, and have been bought for more than
they are worth.”<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c017'><sup>[316]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Daniel Coxe’s description, in 1722, of pearl resources in America,
is of special interest because of the extended experience of his father
as a trader in the country. He states:</p>

<p class='c020'>Pearls are found to be in great abundance in this country; the Indians put
some value upon them, but not so much as on the colored beads we bring them.
On the whole coast of this province, for two hundred leagues, there are many
vast beds of oysters which breed pearls, as has been found in divers places.
But, which is very remarkable, far from the sea, in fresh water rivers and
lakes, there is a sort of shell-fish between a mussel and a , wherein
are found abundance of pearls, and many of an unusual magnitude. The Indians,
when they take the oysters, broil them over the fire till they are fit to eat,
keeping the large pearls they find in them, which by the heat are tarnished and
lose their native lustre; but, when we have taught them the right method,
doubtless it would be a very profitable trade. There are two places we already
know within land, in each of which there is a great pearl fishery. One about</p>

the west side, in a lake made by the river of the Naches, about forty miles
from its mouth, where they are found in great plenty and many very large.
The other on the River Chiaha, which runs into the Coza or Cussaw River (as
our English call it), and which comes from the northeast, and, after a course
of some hundred miles, disembogues into the Gulf of Florida, about one hundred
miles to the east of the Meschacebe.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c017'><sup>[317]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>It is interesting to note that the first place mentioned by Coxe as the
location of a great pearl fishery is not far from one of the most productive
pearling regions of the last fifteen years, <i>viz.</i>, the eastern
part of Arkansas. The second place noted by him appears to be
identical with the Iciaha, where, nearly two centuries before, the
Indians exhibited the methods of their fishing to De Soto and his companions.</p>

<p class='c013'>Excepting Coxe’s notice, for 250 years following 1600, little was
heard of the occurrence of pearls within this country. This does not
indicate necessarily that the gems were absent from the waters; but,
not using the Unios for food as did the aborigines, the residents had
little occasion to open them and in this way learn of their contents.
And even where pearls were occasionally found in mollusks
opened for fish-bait, the people were in few instances informed as to
their market value, and did not attempt to sell them, although the most
attractive ones may have been treasured as ornaments or as keepsakes.
This was paralleled in the diamond fields of South Africa, where gems
worth thousands of dollars were used as playthings by the farmers’
children. A jewel, like a prophet, is frequently without honor in its
own country until the residents of that country learn of the great esteem
in which it is held elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c013'>And yet, in some localities a few pearls were collected from time
to time. The Moravians—familiar with the pearls of their native
streams in Europe—gathered many from the Lehigh River near Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania, over a century ago;<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c017'><sup>[318]</sup></a> and from Rhode Island and
elsewhere a few were obtained.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first awakening to a realization of the value of fresh-water
pearls in America occurred fifty years ago, when several beautiful
gems were marketed from the northern part of New Jersey. The
story of this find has been frequently told. A shoemaker named
David Howell, who lived on the outskirts of Paterson, occasionally
relieved the monotony of his trade by a fishing excursion to some neighboring
stream, where he would usually collect a “mess” of mussels.
Returning from one of these visits to Notch Brook in the spring of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>1857, the mussels were fried with the usual abundance of grease and
heat. After this preparation, one of them was found to contain a large,
round pearl weighing “nearly 400 grains,” which possibly might have
proven the finest of modern times, had not its luster and beauty been
destroyed by the heat and grease.<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c017'><sup>[319]</sup></a> Had the pearl been discovered
in time, its value might have exceeded $25,000, thus making poor
Howell’s fried mussels one of the most expensive of suppers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hoping to duplicate his wonderful find, Howell collected and
searched other mussels, and his example was followed by several of
his neighbors. Within a few days a magnificent pink pearl was found
by a Paterson carpenter named Jacob Quackenbush. This weighed
ninety-three grains, and was bought by the late Charles L. Tiffany
for Messrs. Tiffany &amp; Co., New York City, for $1500. Mr. Tiffany
later described with much interest the feelings he experienced after
making the purchase. Said he: “Here this man finds a pearl within
seventeen miles of our place of business! What if thousands should
be found, and many perhaps finer than this one! However, we risked
buying the pearl, and as no one in New York seemed interested in it,
we sent it to our Paris house for sale, and a French gem dealer offered
for it a very large advance on the original price, paying 12,500
francs.” From this dealer it passed into the possession of the young
and beautiful Empress Eugénie, from whom and from its great luster
it derived the name “Queen Pearl.” Its present market value would
doubtless amount to $10,000 or more.</p>

<p class='c013'>When news of the very large price received for Quackenbush’s find
became public, great excitement developed in the vicinity of Notch
Brook. Persons came from all directions to search in the shallow
streams for valuable pearls. Farmers of the neighborhood tried their
luck, and also mechanics and other residents of the adjacent villages
and towns, and even some from Newark, Jersey City, and New York.
An old resident, who was an eye-witness, describes the scene as one of
great animation, the crowds of people and the horses and wagons
along the shore giving “an appearance of camp-meeting time.” At
least one schoolmaster in the vicinity is said to have closed his school
to give his pupils an opportunity to engage in the hunt.</p>

<p class='c013'>With trousers rolled up, the people waded into the shallow water
and sought for the mussels in the mud and sand on the bottom. Many
pearls were secured, but none approached in size or value the two
above noted.<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c017'><sup>[320]</sup></a> During 1857, the New York City market received about
$15,000 worth of pearls from these waters, and in addition many were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>sold locally or retained as souvenirs of the hunt. At the low price of
pearls existing then, this figure would mean possibly ten times as much
at present, or $150,000.</p>

<p class='c013'>The active search soon depleted the resources of the little stream,
so that in the following year the reported value of the yield was only
a few thousand dollars. The decrease continued until in a few years
practically every mussel was removed, and at present scarcely a single
Unio is to be found in these waters.</p>

<p class='c013'>The interest in pearling extended far from the place of the original
find; and in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and even as far away as Texas,
search was made in the streams. In the Colorado and its tributaries,
about 20,000 were found in a short while. Most of these were small
and unattractive, but a considerable number were reported “as large
as pepper-corns” and a few “the size of a small rifle ball,” the number
decreasing with the increase in size. A correspondent in the “Neue
Zeit” wrote:</p>

<p class='c020'>Sometimes they are round, sometimes cylindrical, elliptical, hemispherical,
or of an altogether irregular shape. The finest have a milk-white, silvery
sheen; many, however, are reddish yellow, bluish brown, or quite black; the
last naturally have no value whatever. As to their value, there is considerable
uncertainty, and it can easily be understood that those who have a great number
of them in their possession greatly overestimate them. So far they are
found principally in the Llano and the San Saba.<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c017'><sup>[321]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>After the resources in northern New Jersey were depleted and the
excitement had died out, little was heard of pearling in this country
until 1878, when many were found in Little Miami River in southwestern
Ohio. The fishing was carried on at low water, and principally by
boys, who would wade out in the water and feel for the mollusks with
their feet, and then bob under and pick them up with their hands. The
senior author spent a day in this fishery with a party of six boys with
some success. During 1878 about $25,000 worth of pearls were collected
in the vicinity of Waynesville on that stream. Mr. Israel H.
Harris, a banker of Waynesville, then began collecting these pearls;
and by purchasing during several years nearly every interesting specimen
found in the vicinity, he made his collection one of the largest and
best known in the country. When sold in 1888, it contained several
thousand pearls, mostly of small size, averaging in weight little more
than one grain each. A large portion of this collection was exhibited
in the American section of the Paris Exposition of 1889, and was
awarded a gold medal. Included in this exhibit was a series of ornaments
in which the gems were arranged according to color, so that in
one the pearls were green, in another purplish brown, in another pink,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>in another waxy white, and in one a cream-white. It also contained
a button-shaped pearl weighing thirty-eight grains and several pink
ones almost translucent. A pink pearl of eight grains was admired by
all who saw it; by reflected light this had the color and translucency
of a drop of molten silver. Many of the pink pearls found in the
Little Miami and its tributaries were of the most beautiful rose-petal
pink; pearls of this peculiar color have never been found in any other
waters.</p>

<p class='c013'>From Ohio the industry gradually extended westward and southward,
and new fields were developed, pearls to the value of about
$10,000 annually coming on the market from such widely separated
States as Vermont, Kentucky, Tennessee, Florida, Texas, Washington,
etc. However, little general interest was taken in fresh-water
pearls, and few choice ones were found until the magnificent resources
of the upper Mississippi Valley were discovered. Owing to the ease
with which the mollusks may be collected by wading, it was in the
relatively shallow tributaries that the fishery first developed, rather
than in the deep channels of the main stream and of the large affluents.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first region in the Mississippi Valley to attract attention was
southwestern Wisconsin. Early in the summer of 1889, many beautiful
pearls were found in Pecatonica River, a tributary of Rock River,
which in turn empties into the Mississippi. Within three months,
$10,000 worth of gems were sent from this region to New York City
alone, including one worth $500, which was a very considerable sum
for a fresh-water pearl at that time. The interest quickly spread to
neighboring waters, and within a short time pearls were found also in
Sugar River, in Apple River, in Rock River, in Wisconsin River, and
in the Mississippi in the vicinity of Prairie du Chien. The fact that
little experience and no capital was required for the business drew
large numbers of persons to the newly-found Klondike; and the finds
were so numerous and of such high quality that about $300,000 worth
of pearls were collected before the end of 1891, greatly exceeding all
records for fresh waters.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Wisconsin pearls are remarkable for their beauty, luster, and
diversified coloring, and some lovely shades of pink, purple, and especially
metallic green have been found. Several of them have weighed
in excess of fifty grains each, and some individual values ran well into
four figures. One shipment made from Sugar River to London in
September, 1890, contained ninety-three pearls, weighing from four
to twenty-eight grains each, for which £11,700 was received in payment.
In the limits of one county in the following year, pearls to the
value of nearly $100,000 were secured.</p>

<p>BROOCHES AND RINGS OF FRESH-WATER PEARLS FROM WISCONSIN AND TENNESSEE<br /><br />Paris Exposition, 1900</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>Shortly following the outbreak of pearling in Wisconsin came the
development of interest in certain parts of Tennessee. For many
years pearls had been secured from the Cumberland and Tennessee
rivers and their tributaries, especially Caney Fork, Duck, Calf Killer,
and Elk rivers, the headquarters of the fishery and the local markets
being Carthage, Smithville, Columbia, and Arlington. The search
had been conducted in a moderate way by pleasure parties in the summer,
and by farmers after the crops had been laid aside.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1901 pearling excitement developed in the mountain regions of
eastern Tennessee, especially in Clinch River. These newly-discovered
resources proved so valuable that the local interest became very great.
Vivid and picturesque accounts published in the local papers reported
hundreds of persons as camping at various points along the streams,
some in tents and some in rough shanties, and others going from shoal
to shoal in newly-built house-boats. They were described as easygoing,
pleasure-loving people, the men, women, and children working
hard all day, subsisting largely on fish caught in the same stream,
and dancing at night to the music of a banjo around the camp-fires.
The center of the new industry was Clinton, the county seat of Anderson
County, whither the successful hunters betook themselves each
Saturday, the preferred time for selling the catch.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next outbreak of pearling excitement was in Arkansas, in the
region referred to by Daniel Coxe two centuries ago as the location of
great pearl resources.<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c017'><sup>[322]</sup></a> Although in recent times little had been heard
of pearls in Arkansas previous to 1895, they were not unknown in that
State. For years they had been picked up by the fishermen, and used
as lucky stones or given to the children for playthings. Some had
come into the possession of persons acquainted with their value.
About 1875, a few pearls were collected by a party of men engaged in
cutting cedar poles on White River; in 1888, a brilliant pear-shaped
pink pearl of twenty-seven grains was secured from the same river,
and sold to a prominent resident. Little had been said about these
finds, and in general the people of Arkansas had slight idea of the
occurrence or the value of pearls in those waters.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1895, a surveying party on White River found pearls in the Unios
of that stream, and collected them to the value of about $5000. News
of this discovery attracted attention to the resource, and other persons
sought for the gems in the White River and its tributaries, in the
St. Francis and the Arkansas rivers. The unusually low water in
1896 facilitated the fishery, and resulted in the discovery of many
large and valuable gems. The interest developed rapidly, and within
twelve months nearly every stream of water in Arkansas yielded
pearls, with the finds most extensive and valuable in White River and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>its tributary the Black River, which has proved to be the richest pearling
region in America. The industry centered at Black Rock, more
than a thousand persons fishing within twenty miles of that place. It
is estimated that within three years following the development of this
fishery, this State yielded pearls to the value of more than $500,000.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Arkansas fishery was at its height, it was reported that
ten thousand persons were employed therein. The fishermen were
from nearly every class and condition in the State. Women were not
absent; even children participated in the industry, and some proved
more fortunate than the older hunters. It was not uncommon to see
several hundred persons congregated at one bar or in one stretch of
the river, all intent on making a fortune, and all occupied in fishing
or in opening the shells. So complete was the absorption of the people
in this pursuit, and so many of the farm-hands were occupied in the
eager search for anticipated fortunes, that the local papers reported
much apprehension and difficulty in harvesting the cotton and other
crops.</p>

<p class='c013'>Within the main channel of the Mississippi, the relative scarcity of
pearls in the Unios, and the greater preparation required for collecting
the mollusks in the deep waters, retarded the fishery until the establishment
of button manufacture afforded a market for the shells, this
originating in 1891. The industry developed rapidly, and for several
years has consumed about 35,000 tons of shells annually, obtained
principally in the Mississippi between Quincy and La Crosse, and to
a much less extent in other streams in this valley. This is more than
twice the total product of mother-of-pearl shell in all parts of the
world. However, the value per ton is very much less than that of the
best grade of mother-of-pearl; that from Australia, for instance, commonly
selling for $1200 per ton, whereas the Mississippi shell usually
sells for less than $20, although the very choicest may bring upward
of $50 per ton.</p>

<p class='c013'>The gathering of shells for manufacture has extended to many of
the large tributaries of the Mississippi, especially the Arkansas, the
White, the St. Francis, the Ohio and the Illinois rivers, and this industry
has added largely to the pearl yield in these waters.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the last three years, the scenes of greatest activity have been the
Wabash River and its tributaries, where shell-collecting developed in
1903,  and the Illinois River, where the industry was of little importance
previous to 1906. On the Wabash, camps were established at
almost every town, from the mouth up to St. Francis, Illinois, and
about one thousand persons found employment. Some of the most
beautiful American gems have come from this river. They are
usually silvery white in color and of the sweetest luster. A single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>pearl weighing only ten grains has been sold at the river for $1000;
but it is frequently the case that a fine gem will sell for more at the
place where found than in the great markets. During the spring of
1907, three pearls were found in the Wabash near Vincennes, which
weighed forty-one, fifty-one, and fifty-three grains respectively. One
of these was white, one faint pink, and the third was yellow. The
finest pearls have been reported from the vicinity of Mount Carmel
near the lower end of the river. Very large quantities of baroques or
slugs are found in the Wabash and the Illinois; 30,000 ounces were
reported from those rivers and their tributaries in 1907, for which the
fishermen received a total of $50,000. A large symmetrical pearl
found during 1907 weighed a trifle under 150 grains, and a slug was
found which weighed fully one ounce, or 606 grains.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearl-hunting excitement has been felt even on the Atlantic
seaboard, as a result of the publication of the discoveries in the Mississippi
Valley. In Maine many pearls have been reported, especially in
the vicinity of Moosehead Lake. In 1901 over one hundred were
found in that vicinity; most of them were of little value, but more than
a dozen were worth $10 or $15 each. Three found by Kineo guides
were sold for an aggregate of $300. The choicest one reported in that
year weighed twelve and one half grains and sold for $150; had it been
perfect in form and luster its value would have been several times that
amount. Most of these pearls were found by Moosehead guides, who
found purchasers among the visiting fishermen and hunters.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since 1901 many farm-boys as well as guides have devoted much
attention to the business, some of them deriving as large a revenue
therefrom as from the use of the rifle. Good finds have been made,
during the last year or two especially. In 1906, one choice pearl sold
for $700, and many have sold for $10 to $75 each. The search has
proven so alluring that returning visitors have complained that some
of the guides care to do little more than search every rill, brook, and
creek they come across looking for the mollusks. Just at present the
principal attention seems to be directed to the streams in the western
part of Maine, where the river-beds are more sandy and the shell-fish
more abundant than in the northern and eastern part of the State.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Massachusetts pearls have been collected from many of the ponds
and brooks. In Nonesuch Pond in Weston, the <i>Unio complanata</i> has
yielded many small ones of attractive appearance, but not of sufficient
size or luster to sell for more than $10 each. Ponds in the town of
Greenwich and also in Pelham in Hampshire County are among the
best in Massachusetts for pearls. The Sudbury River above Concord
also yields many. Relatively few of the Unios contain pearls, and the
gem-bearing individuals seem to be grouped in special localities. Outside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>of these places, thousands of mussels may be opened without revealing
a single gem. A collection of small Massachusetts pearls was
brought together a few years ago by Mr. Sherman F. Denton of
Wellesley Farms, who has devoted much time to exploring the inland
waters of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c013'>Connecticut also has had a slight touch of the pearl fever. In 1897,
Mr. C. S. Carwell of Ledyard, explored the headwaters of Mystic
River, and in a few weeks collected a number of pearls, one of which
he is reported as having sold for $500, and two others were estimated
at $400 each. And from the other end of the State, along the Shepaug
River, is reported a similar account of the success of Mr. Arlo Kinney
of Steep Rock. Attracted by these reports, crowds of seekers have
proceeded in the usual reckless manner to make wholesale destruction
of the mollusks. The finds have been especially large and valuable in the
lakes and streams of Litchfield County, particularly in Bantam Lake.</p>

<p class='c013'>In New York State, pearls have been found in the swift shallow
streams in the Adirondack region, and in several of those entering the
St. Lawrence, particularly the Grass River in St. Lawrence County.
Pearls were first reported from this region in 1894. In 1896 the
Grass yielded one pearl weighing fifty-eight grains, worth $600
locally; and in 1897 one weighing sixty-eight grains was found, the
fisherman selling it for $800. A resident of Russell township devoted
most of his time to pearling in Grass River during 1896 and 1897,
from which he is said to have realized $2000. In this region the mussels
are found by wading in the shallow water and scanning the bottom
through a water-telescope. Most of the pearls are of slight value,
but many individuals are reported as worth from $30 to $60 each.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearl River in Rockland County, New York, has furnished a number
of brown pearls. These are commonly small, weighing from one
eighth to one half grain each, although some weigh seven or eight
grains each. Most of these are not lustrous, but occasionally a bright
brown or a bright copper-brown specimen of from one to four grains
is met with. At the Paris Exposition, in 1900, were exhibited one
hundred of these pearls, with an aggregate weight of 281 grains;
these now form part of the Morgan-Tiffany Collection, in the American
Museum of Natural History.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even in the rich coal regions of Pennsylvania pearls are found.
Possibly the most productive section in that State has been the headwaters
of the Schuylkill River in the vicinity of Tamaqua, Quakake,
and Mahony City. Of the tributaries of the Schuylkill, those contributing
largely to the yield have been Lewiston, Nipert, Still, Locust,
and Hecla. These rise in the mountains and are rivulets of fair size
by the time they reach their common outlet.</p>

<p>PEARL-BEARING UNIOS<br /><br />From the Mississippi Valley<br /><br />The upper pictures show the two valves of the same shell, and the pearl is detachable</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>The original pearl finds in the Schuylkill date from half a century
ago, when they were secured by farmers who used the mussel shells
in removing hair from the hides of slaughtered pigs. During the
Mississippi pearling excitement in 1897, several persons from New
York, who were summering in Schuylkill County, searched the small
streams for pearl-bearing mussels with such success that within a short
while many farmers became enthusiastic hunters during their spare
time. Half a dozen or more men did very well, their catch amounting
to thousands of dollars’ worth. Mr. Frank M. Ebert, of Quakake,
has put most of his spare time in the business in the last ten years, and
has secured many good pearls. It is estimated that the total catch in
Schuylkill County alone approximates $20,000 at local values. So
actively has the search been conducted that at present few adult mussels
of the pearl-bearing species remain, and a day’s work may result
in finding less than a dozen.</p>

<p class='c013'>The best price reported as received by a local fisherman was $200
for a twenty-grain pearl in the year 1904. Many individual specimens
have been sold at prices ranging from $100 to $175. It is claimed that
a pearl sold by a fisherman in Schuylkill for fifty cents was later marketed
in Philadelphia for $125, and with slight mounting was ultimately
sold for $1600. The most attractive weigh from ten to twenty
grains each; larger ones have been found, weighing up to thirty-eight
grains, but as a rule the luster is not so good as that possessed by
pearls of medium size. The common colors are dark blue, pink, lavender,
and white. A few are black and some are brown. The brown
pearls are seldom of value, owing to deficiency in luster.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Maryland pearls have been collected from the brooks near
the head of Chesapeake Bay, and especially in Kent and Cecil counties.
These are of almost every conceivable color, ranging from a clear
white to a dainty pink, and to very dark colors, especially bronze and
copper. Most of them are too small for commercial value, and only
a few reach sufficient size to command more than $5 or $10 each, but
single specimens have sold as high as $50.</p>

<p class='c013'>Georgia has yielded some pearls, chiefly in the vicinity of Rome, at
the junction of the Etowah and Oostanaula rivers. This is believed
to be the site of the Indian town Cofaciqui, where, in his memorable
expedition of 1540–1541, De Soto found the natives in possession of so
many pearls. The general news of finds in the Mississippi Valley
stirred up local interest in this region in 1897, and when the streams
were low and clear in the autumn many persons engaged in hunting
the mussels. An ex-sheriff of Rome is reported as having secured
about fifty pearls, lustrous but irregular. A few miles above Rome,
a farmer made a trial on Johns Creek, a tributary of the Oostanaula;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>and from a basketful of Unios he reports finding several marketable
pearls for which he received $180 from a Baltimore jeweler. Others
followed, and many fine specimens were secured. Unios are especially
abundant in the Flint, Ocmulgee, and Oconee rivers, and it seems probable
that many pearls might be found in these streams.</p>

<p class='c013'>Florida has not yet been actively exploited, but it may prove a productive
region ere long. The reports of De Soto’s expedition make
special reference to the size and beauty of the pearls found at a point
where he crossed the Ocklocknee River about thirty miles above its
mouth, near the present site of Langston, Wakulla County. And
there seems little doubt that pearls may be found in the Ocklocknee
and also in its affluent, the Sopchoppy River. The banks of these
streams are full of shells, and pearls of choice color have been sent
from there.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is unnecessary to refer in detail to the origin of pearling in each
of the States. The general interest in this industry from 1889 to the
present time has resulted in the examination of most of the rivers and
creeks, and in few has the search been entirely unrewarded, although
the finds have been relatively much greater in some waters than in
others. As a rule, pearl-bearing Unios are most numerous in clear,
swift streams, with sandy or gravelly bottoms and which flow through
calcareous rocks. With pearlers as with miners, there is a stampede
to the places where a good find is reported, since the rivers are free
for all; consequently, there is much variation from year to year in the
amount of attention which the individual streams and localities receive.</p>

<p class='c013'>While many of the pearlers operating in the Mississippi River are
professional fishermen or rivermen, most of those in the smaller
streams have had no previous experience in similar work. Frequently
whole families come twenty or thirty miles, and even greater distances,
and camp on the river bank. In many instances farm-hands are there
who have abandoned their crops, mechanics who have left steady jobs,
railway men who have taken a lay-off, teachers, merchants, all eager
and expecting to find a fortune. In some localities, pearl fishing has
been used as an attraction in big picnic advertisements, and has drawn
larger crowds than a public orator.</p>

<p class='c013'>The mollusks are removed from the river bottoms in various ways
and by many forms of apparatus. In the shallow streams the fishermen
simply wade out in the water and pick up the shells by hand. If
not readily visible from the surface, the shells may be located with the
bare feet or by the use of a water-telescope. Where the water is too
deep for wading, the fishermen work from small boats, and use garden
rakes or other convenient inplements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Where pearling has developed into more of an industry, special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>forms of rakes and drags are employed. A shoulder rake, with a
handle twelve to twenty feet in length, is used extensively under the
ice in frozen rivers, and in lakes and other places where the water is
still and from eight to fifteen feet in depth. This is simply an overgrown
or enlarged garden rake, armed with twelve or fifteen iron teeth
about five inches in length. A wire scoop or basket is attached to receive
the catch as it is pulled from the bottom by the teeth, and when
this scoop is well filled it is lifted and the contents dumped on the ice
or into the skiff. This method is laborious, and is employed only
where the water is shallow and the mollusks are abundant. Scissor
tongs—similar to those used by oystermen on the Atlantic coast—are
also employed in some localities, especially in Arkansas, where it is
estimated that 1700 pairs were manufactured and sold in 1899 and
1900, at about $7 each.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the large streams of the Mississippi Valley, with their slow and
steady currents, and where the Unios are taken largely for their shells
to be used in button manufacture, the most popular form of apparatus
since 1896 has been the crowfoot drag. This ingenious contrivance
consists of a cross-bar of hollow iron tubing or common gas-pipe, six
or eight feet long, to which are attached, at intervals of five or six
inches, stout twine or chain snoods or stagings, each about eighteen
inches in length. To each of these are attached three or four prongs
or “hooks,” about six inches apart. These “hooks” are four-pronged,
and are made of two pieces of stout wire bent at right angles to each
other. According to the depth of the water, from twenty-five to
seventy-five feet of three quarter inch rope is attached to the drag
for the purpose of towing it behind the boat, which is permitted to
drift down the stream with the current. This contrivance costs about
$3, and each fisherman generally has at least two of them, as well as a
wide flat-bottom boat costing $5 or $10.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sometimes, when the current is light, the fisherman prepares a
“mule” to assist the boat in towing the resisting drag. This “mule”
consists of a wooden frame, hinged in V-shape, and is fastened several
feet in advance of the boat with the V end pointed down the stream.
It sinks low in the water, and the current pressing against the angle
carries it along, and thus tows the skiff and the resisting drag at a uniform
rate of speed. When there is not sufficient current even for
this contrivance, as in the wide reaches and in the lakes, oars, sails, and
even power engines may be used for propelling the boat.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the crowfoot drag is slowly drawn along the bottom, it comes in
contact with the mollusks feeding with open shells. When a hook or
other part of the drag enters an open shell, the mollusk immediately
closes firmly upon the intruding object and clings thereto long enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>to be drawn up into the boat. In this way, where the Unios are thick,
nearly every hook becomes freighted, and some may have two or three
shells clinging thereto. It is easy to collect fifty mollusks in passing
over a length of two hundred feet. Two drags are carried by each
fisherman, and the second one is put overboard as soon as the first one
is ready to be raised. This is suspended with the bar across two upright
forks on either side of the boat with the prongs swinging freely,
and the mussels are removed therefrom. When this operation is completed,
the drag is put overboard and the other one is ready for lifting.
This apparatus is very effective, and as much as a ton of shells has
been taken by one man in twelve hours, but the average is very much
less, probably not over four or five hundred pounds. Objection is
made to this manner of fishing, since many mollusks not brought to
the surface are so injured that they die.</p>

<p class='c013'>A cruder implement of similar type has long been employed on many
logging streams. The weighted branch of a tree is dragged on the
bottom behind a raft of logs, and the mussels attach themselves to the
twigs in the same manner as on the crowfoot hooks.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the pearling excitement in Arkansas, a considerable portion
of the choice pearls were found, not in the mussels, but lying loosely in
the mud of the shores, indicating that under some circumstances, as
agitation by freshets or floods, the loose pearls are shaken out from the
Unios. In some instances, indeed, the pearls were found upon or in
the soil at some distance from streams or lakes. It is reported that in
October, 1897, Mr. J. W. McIntosh, of the northern part of Lonoke
County, while digging post-holes in the old bed of Cypress Bayou,
found a number of pearls, some “as large as a 44–caliber Winchester
ball,” lying within the shells at a depth of a foot and a half below the
surface. This peculiar occurrence is partly explained by the wide
extension of the waters in flood times over the low region, and by the
shifting of streams and the isolation of cut-offs.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stray pearls have been found in many other odd places, as in
the viscera of chickens and ducks, in the stomachs of fish, and even
within a pig’s mouth. It is not an uncommon scene in the pearling region
to see men raking over the muck in hog-pens along the river banks,
hoping there to find a stray pearl lost from the mussels with which
the animals had been fed by persons who had indeed “cast pearls before
swine.” It is related that a Negro near Marley, Illinois, in this way
secured a pearl weighing 118 grains, for which he received $2000
from a St. Louis buyer, and which was ultimately sold to a New York
dealer for $5000.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>During the height of the Arkansas pearling excitement in 1897, the
speculative spirit was so rife that many persons—unwilling to engage
in the labor of fishing—purchased unopened mussels from the fishermen
in the venture for aleatory profits. The price for these ranged
from twenty-five cents to $2 per hundred, and fluctuated rapidly,
according to the immediate results, increasing several hundred
per cent. in a few minutes under the influence of a valuable find. One
fisherman sold mussels to the value of $28 in one day, and thought he
had made an excellent bargain until over $1000 worth of pearls were
revealed when the shells were opened.</p>

<p class='c013'>While some pearlers work in southern streams throughout the year,
generally the season is coincident with warm weather, when the water
is low and the work may be conducted with comfort. In the vicinity
of Muscatine and Rock Island about twelve years ago, large quantities
of Unios were taken during the winter when the river was frozen
over, the men working with long rakes from the surface of the ice.</p>

<p class='c013'>When only a few mollusks are taken, they are readily opened with
a knife to permit a search for the pearls. But where there are many,
as in the Mississippi River, the opening is facilitated by heating. After
a sufficient catch has been obtained, they are subjected to the action of
steam in a box, or they are heated in an ordinary kettle; a few minutes
of steaming or cooking are sufficient to cause the shells to spring open.
The fleshy parts are removed and thoroughly searched, the interior
surfaces of the shells are likewise examined for attached pearls, and
the liquid at the bottom of the vessel is strained so that nothing of
value may escape.</p>

<p class='c013'>This cooking is a convenient method of opening the shells, but unquestionably
it injures the quality of many pearls. In some instances
when the shells open, the pearls fall out and descend to the heated iron
bottom, where they are quickly injured. The surface of one exposed
too long to the heat shows numerous minute cracks, which increase in
number and size when subjected to changes of temperature. Some
choice gems have in this manner been rendered almost valueless. If
a jacket boiler, or one with a double bottom, were used, there would be
less danger of injuring the pearls; or a similar result could be accomplished
by placing a wire screen a few inches above the bottom.</p>

<p class='c013'>Several fishermen have endeavored to devise mechanical methods
for removing the pearls and thus avoid the painstaking search among
the flesh tissues now necessary; but these contrivances have not proved
satisfactory, and have not been employed except experimentally.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Mississippi and its tributaries, where the fishery is very extensive,
after the pearls have been secured, the shells are sold to button
manufacturers and to exporters at prices ranging from $4 to $40 per
ton, according to species, quality, and market conditions. This provides
a fairly remunerative income to the fishermen even if no pearls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>whatever are found. But in the small tributaries and where the mollusks
are less numerous, the shells are of little value owing to the
expense of bringing them together and conveying them to market.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not every mollusk contains a pearl, and the village belle, intent on
her evening toilet, need not buy a bushel of clams with the pleasant
anticipation of finding a sufficient number of gems for a necklace.
Small and irregular pearls are not at all uncommon, but choice ones
are decidedly scarce, and each one represents the destruction of tens
of thousands of mollusks. Quantities of irregular and imperfect
nodules known as slugs are collected, which sell for only a few dollars
per ounce. In some sections of the Mississippi, the slugs are so very
numerous that their aggregate value exceeds that of the choice pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Mississippi, the percentage of pearls found in a definite quantity
of mollusks is less than in the tributary streams, yet the much
greater quantity of shells collected raises the total yield to a very considerable
amount. Pearling is subordinate and incidental to gathering
the shells for manufacture. In that length of the river from St. Paul
to St. Louis, a fair average yield to the fishermen is about fourteen
dollars’ worth of pearls and slugs to each ton of shells. Of course,
this is not the individual experience, for a single Unio may contain a
gem worth $5000, and on the other hand several tons of shells may
yield only a few cents’ worth of baroques. The market for the shells
places the Mississippi fishing upon an industrial basis, and guarantees
a substantial income to every fisherman even when no pearls whatever
are found.</p>

<p class='c013'>Unios from the upper part of the Mississippi yield a much greater
percentage than those from below Davenport. In 1904, for instance,
from the 4331 tons of shells taken in Wisconsin the fishermen secured
pearls which they sold for $91,345, an average of $21 per ton; from
the 822 tons in Minnesota the average was $16 per ton; in Iowa the
average was $12 for each of the 7846 tons; in Illinois, $5 per ton for
the 2364 tons, and in Missouri less than $1 worth of pearls was secured
by the fishermen for each ton of shells which they took in the year
named. A large number of choice pearls weighing over thirty grains
each were found in the vicinity of Prairie du Chien and McGregor.
Within a river length of one hundred miles in that region, the fishermen
in 1904 gathered pearls which ultimately sold for $300,000. It
is therefore apparent that the returns vary greatly in the different
regions; nevertheless, even in the less productive localities fine pearls
are sometimes found, which contribute to make the industry a profitable
one.</p>

<p class='c013'>Success in pearling is like that in mining. In the White River in
Arkansas, for instance, one man found $4200 worth in one month.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Another discovered a $50 pearl in the first shell he opened. A Negro
found an $85 pearl the first day he worked, while another fisherman
worked seven months and secured less than $10 worth. It is a question
of finding or not finding; the finding brings riches sometimes, and
though the failures reduce the average profits as low as in other local
ventures, the big prizes affect the mind, and the average is lost to sight.
Taking the country as a whole, it is probable that the total find has
been sufficient to pay the average fisherman little if any more than $1
for each day’s work.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fresh-water pearls range in size from that of the smallest seed
to that of a pearl weighing several hundred grains. There is relatively
only a small quantity of seed-pearls, especially when compared with
the output in the fisheries of Ceylon and Persia. Possibly this is due
largely to a scarcity of the parasites which seem to perform so important
a function in the regions noted. A further reason may be
found in the manner in which the mollusks are opened and searched.
Were the Ceylon method of opening employed here—which, however,
is not at all practicable—it seems probable that the quantity of seed-pearls
found in this country would be greatly increased.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearls from the tributaries of the Mississippi are noted for their
great range of coloration. From a dead white, the color is gradually
enhanced to faint shades of pink, yellow, or salmon tints, then to a
more decided form of these. From the light shades, the range extends
to purple and to bright copper red, closely resembling a drop of molten
copper. Some are very light green; others rose, steel blue, or russet
brown, while purplish and very dark brown are not uncommon. White
pearls are probably the most numerous; but pink, bronze, and lavender
are by no means rare.</p>

<p class='c013'>A large percentage of the Mississippi River pearls are very irregular
in form, many of them resembling dogs’ teeth, birds’ wings,
the heads or bodies of different animals, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a rule the fresh-water pearls do not rank so high in value as
those from oriental seas, since ordinarily they are not so lustrous.
However, some of them have sold at very high figures. A round pearl
weighing 103 grains, found in Black River, Arkansas, in 1904, was
eventually sold for $25,000; and one of 68 grains, found, in 1907, on
the Wisconsin side of the Mississippi River, was recently marketed at
$15,000.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the largest American pearl necklaces, brought together in
1904,  consisted of thirty-eight pearls weighing 1710 grains in the aggregate,
an average of 45 grains for each pearl. The central gem
weighed 98½ grains and those on the left of it respectively 85¾,
79⅝, 65¼, 59⅝, 49⅜, 46¼, 45⅛, 43¾, 41½, 40½, 40⅝, 35⅛,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>37⅝, 30, 25⅛, 22¼, 20¼, and 19 grains. The pearls on the right
were graduated as follows: 85¼, 76⅛, 64⅞, 59½, 47¼, 46, 45⅛,
44½, 42½, 41¾, 38, 37⅞, 36, 35, 34⅝, 29½, 25¼, 21, and 20⅜,
grains. This necklace was exhibited at the St. Louis World’s Fair.
It was sold to a London merchant, who in turn sold it to a Parisian
dealer, and it was finally purchased by a Spanish nobleman at a price
said to be about 500,000 francs.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another necklace shown at the St. Louis World’s Fair, was of
American fresh-water pearls from the rivers of Arkansas. The total
weight of these pearls, sixteen in number, was 861⅝ grains, an average
of 61½ grains for each pearl. Of these one drop pearl weighed
77 grains, and two others each 65½ grains. A round pearl of 70
grains completed the adornment of the pendant. The circlet consisted
of ten round pearls alternating with precious stones. The central
pearl weighed 98½ grains and on each side were two of 61 grains,
then two of 56 grains, two of 54⅞, and two of 48 grains, one of 45⅜
grains being at the back of the necklace.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the early days of pearl hunting in American streams, the fishermen
had little idea of their value, and sold choice gems for insignificant
sums. In 1887, a fisherman on Rock River, Illinois, found a 40–grain
pearl which he carried in his pocket for several months. Showing
it one day in Davenport, he was offered $20 for it. He quickly
accepted the offer, and on his return home told his friends about “the
sucker who gave $20 for the shell slug.” At present this “shell slug”
is worth more than one hundred times that amount. Numerous instances
of a similar nature occurred until the average fisherman lost
all confidence in his judgment as to the values, and extravagant ideas
prevailed regarding even almost worthless nacreous concretions.
Thus, when a choice pearl is found, an exorbitant price is set upon it
and the seller feels for the market value by repeated dickerings with
several buyers. And unless one is an expert, he is quite likely to pay
two or three times as much for a pearl at the river bank as in a metropolitan
market. Some of the fishermen collect everything in the shape
of nacreous concretions, and very often pearl buyers in New York and
elsewhere receive packages which are not worth the postage; in many
other packages nine tenths of the lot is worthless; and the practical
joker and the swindler have solicited bids on bright marbles, rounded
pieces of pearl shell, and even sugar-coated pills.</p>

<p class='c013'>While many pearls of fine luster and beautiful and regular form
have been derived from these fisheries, it occasionally happens, in the
case of pearls consigned to the city pearl dealer, that cracks, breaks or
marks, which might detract from their value, are closed or removed,
either by means of water or oil, the pearls having been kept in
one or the other until a few moments before they were shown to the
merchant. Pearls worth hundreds of dollars have sometimes shown
breaks, and in one instance a pearl valued at $7000 showed these cracks
even a very short time after the sale.</p>

<p>THE EVOLUTION OF BUTTONS, MADE FROM MISSISSIPPI SHELLS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>In many of the pearling regions of the Mississippi Valley, inquiry of
almost any fisherman will result in his bringing forth from an inside
pocket a small box padded with raw cotton and containing an assortment
of pearls and slugs. Most of the slugs he will sell at prices ranging
from fifty cents to $5 per ounce, for several of the small pearls
he will likely ask from $2 to $20 each, and one or two of the largest
he may value at $50 or more. At very rare intervals, a choice pearl
will be found, for which he may expect anywhere from $200 to $5000.</p>

<p class='c013'>While the highest prices are not received by the fishermen, there are
many who have been so fortunate as to obtain $1000 or more for a
single pearl, and several have received double that amount. Probably
the highest figure obtained by the original finder was $3800, notwithstanding
exaggerated stories of enormous five-figure prices. Recently
the press credited a lad sixteen years of age with securing $20,000 for
a pearl he had found.</p>

<p class='c013'>A particularly striking yarn relative to a so-called “Queen Mary”
pearl went the rounds of the press some time ago. According to the
newspaper report, this pearl was found by the wife of a fisherman who
was a cripple or something equally pathetic, and, fortunately, when
the family resources were at the lowest. With tears of joy, the fisherman
embraced his wife and told her it was her very own and she should
wear it. However, by means of a check for $17,500, he was induced
to part with it, but only on condition that it be named Queen Mary in
honor of the hard-working wife. The report continues that the original
buyer sold it for $25,000, and at last accounts it was held by a
Chicago dealer who had “refused $40,000 and probably would not
accept $50,000 for it.” The facts seem to be that this pearl, which was
found near Prairie du Chien in 1901 and weighed 103 grains, was
originally sold for $250, and the local buyer sold it in Chicago for
$550, where for many months it was offered at $1000.</p>

<p class='c013'>All sorts of stories of valuable finds are told in the pearling regions:
stories of mortgages that have been released, of homes bought, of college
educations secured from the proceeds of a single gem; but these
tales are offset by the untold stories of the undermining of fine, strong
character in awaiting the turn of fortune which never comes. The
public is quickly apprised of the valuable finds, but it does not hear of
the time and labor lost by the hundreds who are unsuccessful. Pearling
excitement has many of the features of a mining craze. While a
few are benefited, hundreds are made poorer, and in many instances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>reduced to absolute want. Persons have given up their established
business to devote their time to pearling, staking all on the aleatory
profits, and have squandered days and months in the hope that one
great, immense, all-rewarding find will be made. The monotony
of continued disappointment is occasionally brightened by the news
that some one—possibly a near neighbor—has made a lucky find, and
then the work is continued with renewed enthusiasm. A spirit akin to
that which dominates the gambler takes possession of the fisherman,
and the days go on and the seasons go by while the gem that is to bring
the fortune still eludes him. In many localities the pursuit yields far
less profit than pleasure, and many a man who spends a summer in
pearling is in a fair way to spend the winter at the expense of some
one else.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearls are collected for the trade by a score or more of buyers,
who visit the fisheries at intervals and purchase of the individual fishermen
by personal dickering and bargaining. The buyers endeavor to
keep informed of all choice pearls discovered, and when an especially
valuable find is reported each one endeavors to have the first chance to
secure it. The principal local centers of the pearling industry and
marketing are Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin; McGregor, Clinton, and
Muscatine, Iowa; Newport, Black Rock, and Bald Knob, Arkansas;
Clinton, Carthage, and Smithville, Tennessee; St. Francisville, Illinois;
and Vincennes and Leavenworth, Indiana.</p>

<p class='c013'>However, a large number of the pearls from American rivers are
consigned by the finders to well-known gem dealers, the owners depending
for fair treatment on the integrity and high standing of these
experts. An interesting story is told of the pearl and the accompanying
shell in which it was found, which was sent to a New York dealer
by a poor woman. The price she received pleased her immensely; and
in writing her appreciation, she added that she was especially gratified
at receiving so good a price because it enabled her to send her boy to
school. The dealer sent another check as a gift, and a few days before
the next Thanksgiving Day a thirty-five-pound turkey was received
by the four-score-year-old jeweler as an evidence of the mother’s
gratitude.</p>

<p>NECKLACE OF FRESH-WATER PEARLS<br /><br />Paris Exposition, 1900</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>The outbreak of pearl hunting in various parts of the country is
frequently chronicled by the newspapers. These despatches are much
alike, usually telling how some fisherman discovered a beautiful pearl
which he sold to some responsible jeweler for an amount varying from
$100 to $2000. The despatches generally state further that the effect
of the find has been remarkable; the whole region is seized with the
fever, and into the rivers and creeks swarm the hunters of both sexes,
of all ages, and from all classes of the community. Factory-men
leave their mills, farmers their crops, and merchants their stores, and
with the members of their families join in searching for the gems.
The mussels are secured by whatever means is most convenient. If
valuable finds continue, thousands and thousands of mollusks are destroyed
in the search, and when the efforts begin to prove futile the
excitement subsides almost as quickly as it began. In very many
localities the industry has run the whole gamut of the feverish excitement
of its beginning, the humor and romance of its existence, and
the pathos of its ending.</p>

<p class='c013'>If disturbed labor conditions at the height of the excitement were
the only disagreeable attendant, these pearling furors could be viewed
more favorably. But, unfortunately, in many localities, especially in
shoal waters of restricted area, the fishery has been prosecuted so
vigorously that it appears probable the resources will be very materially
impoverished if not ruined in a few years, unless prompt
and decisive protective measures are adopted. In some waters the
crowds engaged in the search have removed practically every mussel
without regard not only to protecting the immature mussels, but even
to the necessity for preserving breeding mollusks. Many ponds and
small river basins have been so denuded that not for many years, if
ever, can they recover their former wealth of pearl-bearers.</p>

<p class='c013'>This state of affairs has not come about without opposition on the
part of those interested in the industry and the general welfare of the
localities. Intelligent and well-directed efforts have been made to provide
a system of regulations for protecting the mussels so that the
maximum yield of pearls may be secured. But this is a very difficult
problem to deal with. It involves not only the methods of fishery, but
the question of sewage disposal by the cities and the large factories,
through which great quantities of mussels have been destroyed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Undoubtedly it will be difficult to devise regulations that will be satisfactory
alike to the fishermen, the button manufacturers and the
farmers. The great desideratum in the pearl fisheries—of the seas
as well as in the fresh-water streams—is a restriction of the gathering
to such mollusks and to such seasons and periods of years as
produce the largest results with the least injury to the permanency of
the resources.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is generally agreed that the young or immature mollusks should
be protected; but it is not easy to determine what is an immature Unio,
as some species never grow large. Likewise, the beds should not be
disturbed when the mollusks are loaded with young, but it is difficult
to select particular months which would be better for close season than
any others. The propositions which seem to be most actively advocated
impose restrictions on the number and size of the mussels to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>taken, a cessation of fishing from January 1 to May 31, closing certain
areas when partly depleted, and prohibiting the use of especially injurious
forms of apparatus. But whatever is done should be done

<p class='c013'>The beautiful pearls of the conch (<i>Strombus gigas</i>) are sought for
in the West Indies and on the neighboring continental coasts. They
are found most abundantly about the Bahamas, a group of more than
four hundred islands off the Florida coast, where many of the fishermen
devote a considerable portion of their time to collecting them. It
is from this industry that the beach-combers of this group of islands,
as well as those of the Florida reefs, have received the designation
“Conchs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Near the shores, where they formerly abounded, a few conchs are yet
picked up by wading fishermen. In waters of medium depth they are
secured either by diving or by means of a long pole with a hook at the
end. In great depths, the mollusks are located by means of a waterglass
similar to the type employed in the Red Sea or among the South
Sea Islands.</p>

<p class='c013'>The animal is readily removed from the shell after crushing the tip
end of the spire where the large muscle is attached. The flesh forms
an important article of food to the fishermen and to the residents of the
outlying islands. It is said that a “Conch” can make a visit to Nassau
of a week or ten days, and subsist almost entirely on this dried meat,
with which he fills his pockets on starting. A large demand exists for
the beautiful shells for ornamenting flower-beds, garden-walks, etc.
Many of them are burned into lime for building purposes. Formerly
several hundred thousand shells were exported annually to England
for use in porcelain manufacture.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearls are generally found embedded in the flesh of the mollusk;
quite often they are in a sac or cyst with an external opening, from
which they are sometimes dislodged by the muscular movement of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>animal. The yield is small, a thousand shells in many cases yielding
only a very small number of seed-pearls or perhaps none at all. Most
of them are oval, commonly somewhat elongated. The usual size is
about one grain in weight, but some of them weigh over twenty, and
a very few exceed fifty grains each. These pearls are generally of a
deep pink color, shading toward whitish pink at each end. While this
is the usual color, yellow, white, red, and even brown conch pearls are
occasionally obtained; these are not so highly prized as the pink ones.
Conch pearls present a peculiar wavy appearance and a sheen somewhat
like watered silk, a result of the reflections produced by the
fibrous stellated structure. While many are beautifully lustrous, they
are commonly deficient in orient, and the color is somewhat evanescent.</p>

<p class='c013'>Most of the Bahama conch fishermen sell their catch of pearls at
Nassau. According to the late Mr. Frederick E. Stearns, there are in
Nassau four dealers who have an arrangement with Paris and London
houses, to whom they can ship pearls in any number and draw against
them with a bill of lading. In addition to these, there are a dozen
dealers in Nassau who buy what pearls they can secure and offer them
for sale.</p>

<p class='c013'>The value of conch pearls is as variable as their form, color, and size,
and they are sold by the fishermen at prices ranging from twenty-five
cents to one dollar or more each. Those weighing from three to ten
grains, and of good color and luster, but not quite regular in form, sell
for about $10 per grain; those of exceptional perfection in color and
form, and of about the same weights, sell for from $15 to $30 per
grain. In other and exceptional cases, where the size is very large, the
form perfect, and the color and luster choice, the value is enhanced to
several hundred and even several thousand dollars each. A perfect
conch pearl is among the most rare and most valuable of gems. An unusually
choice one has sold in New York City for more than $5000.
The yield fluctuates considerably, but perhaps averages about $85,000
in value annually. One of the finest conch pearls ever found is shown
on the plate with the conch shell.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are two important materials that have occasionally been sold
and mistaken for the conch pearl. First, the pale Italian, Japanese,
or West Indian coral, with a color very closely approaching that of
the pearl. By means of a lens it can readily be seen that the coral is
in layers, and does not possess the concentric structure of the pearl, or
the peculiar interwoven structure, with its characteristic sheen, so
frequent in conch pearls. Secondly, the pink conch shell in which the
pearl itself is found; this is frequently cut to imitate the pearl and
sold as such in the West Indies and elsewhere. This can also be detected
by the fact that the layers are almost horizontal and the structure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>is not concentric or interwoven, as it is in the conch pearl, while
the luster is more like that of the shell than that of the pearly nacre.</p>

<p class='c013'>Streeter relates that many years ago an ingenious American turned
out some bits of conch shell into the shape of pearls and placed them
in the conch shells. A slight secretion formed over them, but it was
not the true pearly secretion, and the layer was very thin, so that the
deception was easily detected.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not the least interesting of the American pearl fisheries is that
which has the abalones (Haliotis) for its object. These occur in
many inshore tropical and semi-tropical waters, and particularly in the
marginal waters of the Pacific. They attach themselves to the rocks
by means of their large muscular disk-shaped foot, which acts like a
sucker or an exhaust-cup.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the California coast the abalones are gathered in large quantities
for the pearls, for the shells, and especially for the flesh, which is dried
and used for food. The principal fishing grounds are at Point Lobos
in Monterey County, and along the shores of Catalina and Santa Rosa
islands in Santa Barbara County, with smaller quantities from Halfmoon
Bay and from the rocks along the shores of Mendocino County.
At low tide the fishermen wade out in shallow water, and, by means of
a knife, separate the mollusk from its resting-place. Unless this is
done quickly and before the mollusk has time to prepare itself for the
attack, it closes down on the rock by means of its sucker-like foot, from
which it cannot be removed without breaking the shell. A story is told
at Santa Barbara of a Chinese fisherman having been drowned off one
of the outer islands by having his hand caught underneath the shell
of an abalone.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few years ago, Japanese fishermen introduced the use of diving-suits
in taking these mollusks in three fathoms of water; but in March,
1907, the California legislature interdicted this form of fishery. That
legislature also interdicted the capture of black abalones measuring
“less than twelve inches around the outer edge of the shell, or any
other abalone, the shell of which shall measure less than fifteen inches
around the outer edge.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The animal is removed from the shell by thrusting a thin blade of
soft steel between the flesh and the shell, and thus loosening the great
muscle. The flesh is salted and boiled, and then strung on long rods to
dry in the open air. When properly cured, the pieces are almost as
hard and stiff as sole leather. Most of it is packed in sacks and exported
to China, but large quantities are sold on the Pacific coast at
from five to ten cents per pound. The catch is much less than it was
forty years ago.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>Many pearly masses are obtained from the abalones, and a few of
these are of considerable beauty. Some are very large, measuring two
inches in length and half an inch or more in width; but they are rarely
of good form, and their value is commonly far less than that of choice
Oriental pearls. Owing to their irregularity in form, they are scarcely
suitable for necklaces. One of the best necklaces of these pearls ever
brought together sold a few years ago for $2000; but individual specimens
have exceeded $1000 in market value. While abalone pearls are
not on the market in any great quantities, one resident of Santa Barbara
has a collection of more than a thousand specimens, ranging in
value from several hundred dollars to less than one dollar each. Most
of the objects sold in curio and jewelry stores on the Pacific coast as
abalone pearls are simply irregular knots or protuberances cut from
the surface of the shell. The California fishermen are credited with
having received $3000 for the abalone pearls in 1904; but it is safe to
say that this represents only a small fraction of their final sale value.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the river mussels of Canada, and especially in those from the
Province of Quebec, and the Ungava Region, pearls are occasionally
found. These are usually white and of good luster. They are not the
object of systematic search, but in the aggregate many are secured by
Indians and Eskimos, and some by the trappers and fishermen who operate
from Quebec and Montreal. A number, weighing from one to
sixty-five grains each, were shown at the Colonial Exhibition in London
in 1886, and received favorable notice. Recently, two beautifully
matched pink pearls, weighing about fourteen grains each, were obtained
from one mussel. A single pearl found in Canada has sold for
$1000, but as a general rule they are of relatively little value. The
Hudson Bay traders are represented as having secured a fair share of
these pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the last few years, many pearls have been found in the
streams of Prince Edward Island and of New Brunswick Province,
and also in those of Nova Scotia. Most of them are well formed, but
their color is generally inferior and their luster deficient. Many of
them are buff or brown in color, some are bright and fairly good, a few
are rose-tinted, and others are slate-colored and even almost black.
Toronto jewelers report that many Canadian pearls are in the possession
of farmers and others in the lower provinces, held by them for
higher prices than the jewelers are willing to pay. The Nova Scotia
pearls are from a bivalve which has been identified as <i>Alasmodon margaritifera</i>.
They are especially abundant in Annapolis and King
counties.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even in the streams of northern Labrador and of the Caniapuscaw
watershed, pearls are obtained by the natives, and by the hunters and
fishermen who resort to that desolate country. These closely resemble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>the pearls of Scotland in color, size, and luster. A story is told of a
fisherman who by chance found in one shell two well-matched pearls,
which he later sold for $150; so pleased was he with his success that he
spent a fortnight in diligent search, but secured only half a dozen small
ones, worth perhaps $3 for the lot. Most of these pearls are silvery
white, but beautiful pink ones are not rare. An unusually choice 20–grain
pearl from this region sold in 1905 for $1000.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the coast of Ecuador, pearl fisheries of minor importance have
been prosecuted from time to time. Dr. H. M. Saville, of the American
Museum of Natural History, states that in his explorations in that
country he frequently came across evidence of pearls and the information
that fisheries had existed on the coast centuries ago.</p>

<p class='c013'>An interesting letter from that world-wide traveler and interesting
writer, William E. Curtis, states that formerly there was a pearl fishery
on the coast of Ecuador at the little town known as Manta, in the
Province of Manabi; but it had to be abandoned on account of a particularly
voracious species of fish called <i>el manti</i>, which abounds in
that locality and gives the place its name. Pearls are said to be even
more abundant at Manta than in Panama Bay. It is reported that this
is the place where the Incas obtained those splendid gems which the
Spaniards found in the palaces and temples of Peru.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the waters of Costa Rica, pearl-oysters are found, and at times
the fishery has been of considerable local importance. Owing to fear
of injury to the reefs, the use of diving machinery was interdicted
there a few years ago; but in 1906 its employment was authorized
under certain restrictions. Licenses good for six months were
authorized for a maximum of thirty machines, which may work at a
minimum depth of thirty-seven feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the coast of Colombia, South America, scattered reefs of pearl-oysters
occur. A lease of the pearl fisheries and those for corals and
sponges was granted July 2, 1906, but it is unknown what results have
followed. This lease lasts five years, beginning August 1, 1906.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is almost an absolute paucity of information in regard to the
occurrence of fresh-water pearls in other parts of South America. The
only data we have obtained are from Prof. Eugene Hussak of the
Mining School of Sao Paulo, Brazil, who writes us that some pearls
have been obtained from one of the Bahia rivers. Possibly, when the
resources of the interior of that continent are better known, many
pearls may be found.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>The great profit that would accrue from an increased output of
pearls has long directed attention to the problem of bringing
this about by artificial means.</p>

<p class='c013'>In his life of Apollonius of Tyana, Philostratus, a Greek
writer of the third century, repeats a story afloat at the time, which
credited the Arabs of the Red Sea with possessing some method of
growing pearls artificially. The story as it reached Greece was that
they first poured oil upon the sea for the purpose of calming the waves,
and then dived down and caused the oysters to open their shells. Having
effected this, they pricked the flesh with a sharp instrument and
received the liquor which flowed from the wounds into suitable molds,
and this liquor there hardened into the shape, color, and consistence of
the natural gems.<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c017'><sup>[324]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>While the description given by Philostratus is charged with many
improbable details, and could scarcely develop belief, even in the most
credulous, as to the exact method of procedure, it seems that the story
may not have been wholly without foundation, and that attempts were
made at that remote date to stimulate the growth of pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>In more modern times, the possibility of aiding or starting pearly
formations in mollusks seems first to have been conceived by the
Chinese about the fourteenth century. In 1736 there appeared in that
storehouse of Oriental information, “Lettres édifiantes et curieuses
écrites des missions étrangères,”<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c017'><sup>[325]</sup></a> a communication from F. X. de
Entrecolles, dated Pekin, 4th November, 1734, which set forth that
there were people in China who busied themselves with growing pearls,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>and the product was not only vastly superior to the imitations manufactured
in Europe, but were scarcely to be distinguished from the
genuine. From Father Entrecolles’s very detailed quotation of his
unnamed Chinese authority, we condense this account. In a basin
one half full of fresh water, place the largest mussels obtainable, set
this basin in a secluded place where the dew may fall thereon, but
where no female approaches, and neither the barking of dogs nor the
crowing of chickens is to be heard. Pulverize some seed-pearls (<i>Yo
tchu</i>), such as are commonly used in medicine, moisten this powder
with juice expressed from leaves of a species of holly (<i>Che ta-kong
lao</i>), and then roll the moistened powder into perfectly round pellets
the size of a pea. These are permitted to dry under a moderate
sunlight, and then are carefully inserted within the open shells of
the mollusks. Each day for one hundred days the mussels are nourished
with equal parts of powdered ginseng, china root, <i>peki</i>, which
is a root more glutinous than isinglass, and of <i>pecho</i>, another medicinal
root, all combined with honey and molded in the form of rice
grains.</p>

<p class='c013'>Although extremely detailed in some particulars, the Chinese account
omits much to be desired as to the method in which the shells
were opened to receive the pellets and the nourishment, and as to the
importance of seclusion from females and loud noises. Admitting
that it is “inaccurate and misleading,” this letter seems to indicate very
clearly that the Chinese had some method of assisting nature in growing
pearls in river mussels.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first person in Europe whose suggestion of the possibility of
pearl-culture attracted general attention was Linnæus, the Swedish
naturalist (1707–1778). In a letter to Von Haller, the Swiss anatomist,
dated 13th September, 1748, he wrote: “At length I have ascertained
the manner in which pearls originate and grow in shells; and in
the course of five or six years I am able to produce, in any mother-of-pearl
shell the size of one’s hand, a pearl as large as the seed of the
common vetch.”<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c017'><sup>[326]</sup></a> There was much secrecy about Linnæus’s discovery,
and even yet there is uncertainty as to the details of the method.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>The Linnean Society of London apparently possesses some of the
very pearls grown by Linnæus, as well as several manuscripts which
throw much light on this subject. It appears from the latter that,
under date of 6th February, 1761, Linnæus wrote that he “possessed
the art” of impregnating mussels for pearl production, and offered for
a suitable reward from the state to publish the “secret” for the public
use and benefit. A select committee of the state council of Sweden
was appointed to confer with him, and on 27th July, 1761, the
naturalist appeared and verbally explained his discovery. After
various meetings, the select committee approved the “art” and recommended
a compensation of 12,000 dalars (about $4800). It does not
appear that the award was paid, and the following year the secret was
purchased by Peter Bagge, a Gothenberg merchant, for the sum of
6000 dalars. On 7th September, 1762, King Adolph Frederick issued
a grant to this merchant “to practice the art without interference or
competition.”<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c017'><sup>[327]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Peter Bagge was unable to exercise the rights which he had acquired,
nor was he able to dispose of them to advantage. On his death
the memorandum of the secret became lost, and it was not found until
about 1821, when it was discovered by a grandson, J. P. Bagge. Under
the date of 27th February, 1822, the King of Sweden confirmed
to this grandson the privileges which his ancestor had purchased in
1762. Fruitless efforts were again made to dispose profitably of the
rights either to individuals or to the Swedish government.</p>

<p class='c013'>The details of Linnæus’s “secret” have never been published authoritatively.
In his “History of Inventions,” Beckmann states that before
the naturalist thought of the profits that might accrue from his discovery,
he intimated the process in the sixth edition of his “Systema
naturæ,” wherein he states: “Margarita testæ excrescentia latere interiore,
dum exterius latus perforatur.”<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c017'><sup>[328]</sup></a> “I once told him,” says
Beckmann, “that I had discovered his secret in his own writings; he
seemed to be displeased, made no inquiry as to the passage, and
changed the discourse.”<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c017'><sup>[329]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In the second volume of his edition of “Linnæus’s Correspondence,”<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c017'><sup>[330]</sup></a>
Sir J. E. Smith remarks: “Specimens of pearls so produced by art in
the <i>Mya margaritifera</i> are in the Linnean cabinet. The shell appears
to have been pierced by flexible wires, the ends of which perhaps remain
therein.” Referring to this remark, J. P. Bagge comments:
“This is the nearest I have seen any one come to truth, but still it will
be remarked by reading the ‘secret’ that more information is required
to enable persons to practice the art.”</p>

<p class='c013'>After a thorough examination of the manuscripts and other material,
Professor Herdman concludes that the essential points of Linnæus’s
process are to make a very small hole in the shell and insert a
round pellet of limestone fixed at the end of a fine silver wire, the
hole being near the end of the shell so as to interfere only slightly with
the mollusk, and the nucleus being kept free from the interior of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>shell so that the resulting pearl may not become adherent to it by a
deposit of nacre.<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c017'><sup>[331]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly after Linnæus communicated with the Swedish government
and before his death, it was learned in Europe that the art of producing
“culture pearls” by a somewhat similar process had been practised
by the Chinese for centuries.<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c017'><sup>[332]</sup></a> They used several forms of matrices or
nuclei, but principally spheres of nacre and bits of flat metal or molded
lead, which were not infrequently in conventional outline of Buddha.
In the spring or early summer, these were introduced under the mantle
of the living mollusk after the shell had been carefully opened a fraction
of an inch, and the animal was then returned to the pond, or lake.
The mollusk did its work in a leisurely way, like some people who
have little to do, and many months elapsed before it was ready for
opening and the removal of the pearly objects.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most satisfactory description we have seen of this process appears
to be that communicated nearly a century later to the London
Society of Arts by Dr. D. T. Macgowan,<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c017'><sup>[333]</sup></a> through H. B. M. plenipotentiary
in China, from which this account is abridged and modified.</p>

<p class='c013'>The industry is prosecuted in two villages near the city of Titsin,
in the northern part of the province of Che-kiang, a silk-producing region.
In May or June large specimens of the fresh-water mussels,
<i>Dipsas plicatus</i>, are brought in baskets from Lake Tai-hu, about thirty
miles distant. For recuperation from the journey, they are immersed
in fresh water for a few days in bamboo cages, and are then ready to
receive the matrices.</p>

<p class='c013'>These nuclei are of various forms and materials, the most common
being spherical beads of nacre, pellets of mud moistened with juice
of camphor seeds, and especially thin leaden images, generally of
Buddha in the usual sitting posture. In introducing these objects, the
shell is gently opened with a spatula of bamboo or of pearl shell, and
the mantle of the mollusk is carefully separated from one surface of
the shell with a metal probe. The foreign bodies are then successively
introduced at the point of a bifurcated bamboo stick, and placed,
commonly in two parallel rows, upon the inner surface of the shell; a
sufficient number having been placed on one valve, the operation is repeated
on the other. As soon as released, the animal closes its shell,
thus keeping the matrices in place. The mussels are then deposited
one by one in canals or streams, or in ponds connected therewith, five
or six inches apart, and where the depth is from two to five feet under
water.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>If taken up within a few days and examined, the nuclei will be found
attached to the shell by a membranous secretion; later this appears to
be impregnated with calcareous matter, and finally layers of nacre are
deposited around each nucleus, the process being analagous to the
formation of calculary concretions in animals of higher development.
A ridge generally extends from one pearly tumor to another, connecting
them all together. Each month several tubs of night soil are
thrown into the reservoir for the nourishment of the animals. Great
care is taken to keep goat excretia from the water, as it is highly detrimental
to the mussels, preventing the secretion of good nacre or even
killing them if the quantity be sufficient. Persons inexperienced in the
management lose ten or fifteen per cent. by deaths; others lose virtually
none in a whole season.</p>

<p class='c013'>In November, the mussels are removed from the water and opened,
and the pearly masses are detached by means of a knife. If the matrix
be of nacre, this is not removed; but the earthen and the metallic matrices
are cut away, melted resin or white sealing-wax poured into the
cavity, and the orifice covered with a piece of shell. These pearly
formations have some of the luster and beauty of true pearls, and are
furnished at a rate so cheap as to be procurable by almost any one.
Most of them are purchased by jewelers, who set them in various personal
ornaments, and especially in decorations for the hair. Those
formed in the image of Buddha are used largely for amulets as well as
for ornaments. They are about half an inch long, and while in the shell
have a bluish tint, which disappears with removal of the matrix.
Quantities of them are sold as talismans to pilgrims at the Buddhist
shrines about Pooto and Hang-chau.</p>

<p class='c013'>In some shells the culture pearls are permitted to remain by the
Chinese growers, for sale as curios or souvenirs; specimens of these
have found their way into many public and private collections of
Europe and America. These shells are generally about seven inches
long and four or five inches broad, and contain a double or triple row
of pearls or images, as many as twenty-five of the former and sixteen
of the latter to each valve. That the animal should survive the introduction
of so many irritating bodies, and in such a brief period secrete
a covering of nacre over them all, is certainly a striking physiological
fact. Indeed, some naturalists have expressed strong doubts as to its
possibility, supposing the forms were made to adhere to the shell by
some composition; but the examination of living specimens in different
stages of growth, with both valves studded with them, has fully demonstrated
its truth.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is represented that in the northern part of the Che-kiang province
about five thousand families are employed in this work in connection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>with rice-growing and silk-culture. To some of them it is the chief
source of income, single families realizing as much as 300 silver
dollars annually therefrom. In the village of Chung-kwan-o, the
headquarters for culture pearls in China, a temple has been erected to
the memory of the originator of this industry, Yu Shun Yang, who
lived late in the thirteenth century, and was an ancestor of many persons
now employed thereby.</p>

<p class='c013'>The method in vogue in China for so many centuries has been the
starting-point for similar attempts in various other countries. During
the New Jersey pearling excitement in 1857, there were found
several spherical pieces of nacre which had been introduced into Unios
apparently for experimental pearl-culture; and in the collection of
shells bequeathed to the United States National Museum by the late
Dr. Isaac Lea, is a hemispherical piece of candle grease partly coated
with pinkish nacre. Kelaart applied the Chinese method to the Ceylon
pearl-oysters with much success in 1858. At the Berlin Fisheries
Exhibition, in 1880, appeared the results of experiments in growing
culture pearls in the river mussels in Saxony. Small foreign bodies
had been introduced in the mantle, and others had been inserted between
the mantle and the shell. These nuclei consisted of shell beads,
unsightly pearls from other mussels, etc.; but unfortunately the shape
of these was such that the mantle could not fit closely around them,
consequently the result was so irregular as to be of no value except to
show that German Unios as well as those of China could be made to
cover foreign objects with pearly material.</p>

<p class='c013'>Professor Herdman notes that, between 1751 and 1754, an inspector
named Frederick Hedenberg received an annual salary “to inoculate
the pearl-mussels of Lulea (in the northern part of Sweden) with
‘pearl-seeds’ which he manufactured, and then to replant the mussels.
Certain pearls were produced by the inspector, which it is recorded
were sold for some 300 silver dollars.”<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c017'><sup>[334]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>As noted by Broussonnet, in Finland artificial pearls were produced
by inserting a round piece of nacre between the inner face of the shell
and the mantle. The owner of the pearl fisheries at Vilshofen has
succeeded in producing pearly figures by introducing into the mollusk
flat figures of pewter, most of them representing fish in form.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1884, Bouchon-Brandely made experiments in pearl production
at Tahiti. Gimlet holes about half an inch in diameter were drilled
through different places in the shells of pearl-oysters, and through
each of these holes a pellet of nacre or of glass was inserted and held
by brass wire passing through a stopper of cork or burao wood, by
means of which each opening was hermetically closed, so that the
pellet was the only foreign substance protruding on the inside of the
shell.<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c017'><sup>[335]</sup></a> The oysters were returned to the sea without further injury,
and after the lapse of a month the pellets were found covered
with thin layers of nacre.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>Experiments in growing pearls in the abalone or Haliotis were made
in 1897 by Louis Bouton, an account of which was given at the meeting
of the Paris Académie des Sciences in 1898.<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c017'><sup>[336]</sup></a> The tenacity of life
in this mollusk makes it especially desirable for experiments of this
nature. Through small holes bored into the shell, pellets of mother-of-pearl
were inserted and placed within the mantle, the small holes being
afterward closed up. Other nacreous pellets were introduced directly
into the bronchial cavity. The objects were soon covered with thin,
pearly layers, resulting in a few months in spheres of much beauty,
resembling somewhat the pearls naturally produced by this mollusk.
In six months, according to M. Bouton, the layers became of sufficient
thickness to be attractive. Within limitations, the size of the pearl
produced is in proportion to the length of time it is allowed to remain
within the mollusk. The results of the experiments seem to encourage
further efforts in this line, and possibly in course of time there may be
a profitable business in growing pearls in abalones on the Pacific coast
of the United States. Indeed, the experiments in transplanting and
cultivating the pearl-oyster in Australia leads one to fancy that the
culture of that species in the warm coastal waters of America is by no
means an impossibility.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many other experiments along similar lines have been made more
recently. An interesting feature of attempts made by Mr. Vane Simmonds
of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 1896–1898, is that in order to avoid
straining the adductor muscles by forcibly opening the shell while the
mollusk resisted the intrusion, each selected Unio was exposed in the
open air and sunshine until the valves opened; then a wooden wedge
was carefully inserted in the opening, and the mollusk immediately
immersed in water to revive it or to sustain life. After a few moments
of immersion, the operator carefully raised the mantle from the
shell, inserted the pellet of wax or other small article to be covered
with nacre, drew the mantle to its normal position, removed the wedge,
and returned the mollusk to a selected place in the stream at sufficient
depth to avoid danger of freezing in winter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Probably it would be more satisfactory to stupefy the mollusks by
means of some chemical in order to insert the pellets. Marine mollusks
have been successfully stupefied by slowly adding magnesium
sulphate crystals to the sea water until the animals no longer respond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>to contact. If treatment is not too prolonged, they may be returned to
normal sea water with good prospects of recovery. To stupefy fresh-water
mollusks, either chloral hydrate or chlorosone may be employed,
although the latter is expensive to use in great quantity. Dr. Charles
B. Davenport, of the Carnegie Institution, suggests that it might be
well to experiment with pouring ether or chloroform over them.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Japan the production of these pearly formations in <i>Margaritifera
martensi</i>, which is closely related to the Ceylon oyster, has developed
into some prominence since 1890, and the results have been well
advertised. The industry is located in Ago Bay, near the celebrated
temple of Ise in the province of Shima, and gives employment to
about one hundred persons. It is stated that the proprietor, Kokichi
Mikimoto, has leased about one thousand acres of sea bottom, on
which are a million oysters of this species, which yield from 30,000
to 50,000 culture pearls annually.</p>

<p class='c013'>As described by Dr. K. Mitsukuri, the shoal portions of this area
are used for breeding the oysters and raising them to maturity, and
in the deeper parts—covered by several fathoms of water—the
oysters are specially treated for producing the culture pearls. In the
former, the spat is collected on small stones, weighing six or eight
pounds each, placed during May or June. The following November
these stones, with the attached spat or young, are removed, for protection
from cold, to depths greater than five or six feet, where they remain
for about three years. At the end of that period, the growing
oysters are taken from the water, the shells opened slightly, and
rounded bits of pearl shell or nacre are introduced under the mantle
without injury to the mollusks. About 300,000 are thus treated annually,
and placed in the deeper water at the rate of about one to each
square foot of bottom area. After the lapse of about four years more,
the oysters are removed from the water and opened, when a large percentage
of the pellets are found covered on the upper or exposed surface
with nacre of good luster.</p>

<p class='c013'>Most of these culture pearls are button-shaped and weigh two or
three grains each. Although somewhat attractive and superior to
the culture pearls of China and other fresh waters, they by no means
compare favorably with choice pearls. They are rarely, if ever,
spherical, and only the upper surface is lustrous; consequently they
serve only the purpose of half-pearls. A cross section shows the
nacreous growth in a thin concentric layer, forming a fragile hemispherical
cap, the concave wall of which is covered with a brownish
granular secretion which prevents perfect adhesion. Compared with
choice pearls, they are not only deficient in luster, but are fragile, and
are beautiful only on the upper surface, and not available for necklaces.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Good specimens sell for several dollars each, and some individuals
reach $50 or more. Specimens exhibited at the Paris
Exposition in 1900 were awarded a silver medal; at the St. Petersburg
Exhibition in 1902 they were awarded a gold medal; at the Tokio
Exhibition a grand prize, and a medal at the St. Louis Exposition in
1904. The awards were given in the fisheries, and not the gem divisions.</p>

<p class='c013'>The work of Mikimoto is not the only attempt now being made in
Japan to produce pearls. A letter from Dr. T. Nishikawa, of the
Tokio Imperial University, states: “It is a great pleasure for me to
tell you that I am studying pearl formation and pearl-oyster culture
in the university laboratory, and recently I have got my pearl laboratory
at Fukura, on the Island of Awaji, where I began the pearl-culture
work this summer (1907). Fortunately, I found the cause of
Japanese pearl formation, <i>i.e.</i>, the reason why and how the pearl is
produced in the tissue of an oyster. I made practical application of
this theory with great prospects for producing the natural and true
pearls at will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the most interesting of the pearl-culture enterprises are
those of the Compañia Criadora de Concha y Perla, under the direction
of Sr. Gaston J. Vives, in the Gulf of California. This company
has an extensive station at San Gabriel, near La Paz, where breeding
oysters are placed in prepared chests or cages for collecting the spat
on trays. After remaining there for several weeks or months, the
young mollusks are removed to prepared places (<i>viveros</i>) for further
growth. Experiments are now made in depositing them between a
series of parallel dams alternately touching each shore of a lagoon,
thus developing a current of water over the oysters for conveying
food to them, and thus hastening their growth.</p>

<p class='c013'>In efforts to increase the output of pearls, attention has been given
to the possibilities for extending the area and production of the reefs,
and for stocking new areas and replenishing exhausted ones, thus
bringing the pearl-bearing mollusks to maturity in greater abundance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Although theoretically it does not seem a very difficult undertaking
to cultivate the pearl-oysters by methods somewhat similar to the cultivation
of edible oysters and clams, in no part of the world has this
been successfully done on an extensive scale. While in certain minor
cases, the areas of some species of pearl mollusks have been extended
indirectly through man’s agency—as the range of the Red Sea pearl-oyster
into the Mediterranean since the Suez Canal was opened—there
is no well-known instance in which new areas have been abundantly
populated through direct efforts.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the chapter on the pearl fisheries of Asia are noted the hitherto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>unsuccessful efforts made in Ceylon and India to preserve the young
and immature oysters on the storm-swept reefs by removing them to
less exposed areas. This has received close attention from the Ceylon
authorities during the last two years. Other practical measures
which are recommended for that region include “cultching,” or the
deposit of suitable solid material, such as shells or broken stone, to
which the young oysters can attach themselves; thinning out overcrowded
reefs, and cleaning the beds by means of a dredge, thereby
removing starfish and other injurious animals. The attempts made
by individuals and associations to extend the range of the reefs on the
coast of Australia, among the Tuamotu Islands, in the Gulf of California,
and some other localities, are noted in the appropriate chapters.
But it may be stated that in most instances lack of adequate police protection
has been not the least of the difficulties with which these experiments
have had to contend.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor has much greater success followed upon efforts to prevent the
exhaustion of the reefs and productive grounds through overfishing,
except in those instances in which the government exercises a proprietory
interest and determines the season, the area to be fished, and the
quantity of mollusks to be removed. The most prominent instance of
this is in Ceylon, where the fishery has been restricted to such seasons
and periods as appeared to insure the maximum yield of pearls.
Without restriction upon the fishery, the pearl-oyster in that populous
region would doubtless become almost extinct in a few years. Another
instance of proprietory interest on the part of the government is
in some of the German States, where pearl fishing has been regulated
and restricted for centuries. But there the sewage from cities and
factories has accomplished almost as effectively, if less rapidly, what
unrestricted fishing would have done.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much attention has been given to the subject of pearl-culture in
Bavaria, where the government has granted a small subsidy to encourage
this industry, and a model pearl-mussel bank has been established
in one of the brooks for the rational culture of the mussels.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the Australian coast, the only theoretical protection of consequence
is the restriction on taking small or immature oysters; but,
owing to the great area over which the fisheries are prosecuted there,
it has not been possible to enforce the regulations. At some of the
Pacific islands and elsewhere, interdictions exist as to use of certain
apparatus of capture, but this is intended for the purpose of reserving
the industry to dependent natives rather than for protecting the reefs.
Several efforts have been made to insure adequate protection for the
Unios in our American rivers, but nothing in this direction has yet
been accomplished by legislative enactment, except in Illinois.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>Reference has already been made to the parasitic stage of Unios.<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c017'><sup>[337]</sup></a>
The attachment of the newly-hatched mollusks to the gills or fins of a
fish is entirely a matter of chance, and unless this takes place they die
within a few days. Under natural conditions the fish thus infected
will rarely be found carrying as many of the parasitic Unios as they
can without serious injury. If the fish are placed in a tank or a pond
containing large numbers of newly-hatched Unios, it is possible to
bring about the attachment of hundreds of them for every one that
would be found there by chance of nature. A fish six inches in length
may thus be made to carry several hundred parasitic Unios, and thus a
thousand fish artificially infected may do the work of several hundred
thousand in a state of nature. Experiments with small numbers of
fish under observation in the laboratory indicate that their infection
on a large scale is entirely possible, and the experiment by Messrs.
Lefevre and Curtis now in progress at La Crosse, Wisconsin, in which
over 25,000 young fish have been infected, gives every indication that
such work may be begun even with the scanty knowledge now possessed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since it has already been shown that the production of pearls is an
abnormal condition, it does not follow that an increase in the quantity
of mollusks would necessarily result in a corresponding increase in the
yield of pearls. Indeed, it might even be that the artificial conditions
bringing about an enhanced prosperity and abundance of the mollusks
would result in a corresponding decrease in the product of gems, the
improved surroundings impairing if not destroying the conditions to
which the pearls owe their origin. This has resulted in directing efforts
toward abnormally increasing the abundance of pearls in a definite
number of mollusks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The development of the parasitic theory of pearl formation has
naturally invited attention to the possibilities of increasing the yield
of pearls by inoculating healthy mollusks with distomid parasites. It
does not appear that this has yet advanced beyond the experimental
stage, and virtually all that has been accomplished has been set forth
in the chapter on the origin of pearls. It seems that there are great
possibilities in the artificial production along these lines; and that
under skilful management it could be made a profitable industry, especially
if carried on concurrently with the systematic cultivation of
mother-of-pearl shells.</p>

<p class='c013'>Although there is scientific basis for the belief that it may be possible
in time to bring about pearl growth in this manner, the public should
not be too hasty in financing companies soliciting capital for establishing
so-called “pearl farms.” Every once in a while announcement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>is made in the public press of wonderful success which has been attained
by some investigator, who surrounds his discovery with as much
mystery as enveloped the Keeley motor, and who is as anxious to sell
stock as was the owner of that mythical invention. A prospectus of
one of these “pearl syndicates,” which is now before us, claims to “increase
and hasten pearl production by forcing the oyster, through doctoring
the water in which it is immersed and also by irritating the
mollusk itself.” So far as the writers are aware, aside from the inexpensive
but somewhat attractive culture pearls, no commercial success
has yet followed the many attempts at artificial production.</p>

<p class='c013'>This chapter should not close without reference to the so-called
“breeding pearls,” probably the most curious of all theories of pearl
growth, regarding which many inquiries have been made. Throughout
the Malay Archipelago there exists a generally accepted belief that
if several selected pearls of good size are sealed in a box with a few
grains of rice for nourishment they will increase in number as well as
in size. If examined at the expiration of one year, small pearls may
be found strewn about the bottom of the box, according to the theory;
and in some instances the original pearls themselves will be found to
have increased in size. If again inclosed for a further period of a
year or more, the adherents of the theory say, the seed-pearls will
further increase in size, and additional seed-pearls will form.
Furthermore, the grains of rice will present the appearance of having
been nibbled or as though a rodent had taken a bite in the end of each.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is claimed that the breeding pearls are obtained from several species
of mollusks, mostly from the Margaritifera, but also from the
Tridacna (giant clam) and the Placuna (window shell). While
cotton is the usual medium in which the pearls and rice are retained,
some collectors substitute fresh water and yet others prefer salt water.
It seems that rice is considered essential to success.</p>

<p class='c013'>The earliest account we have seen of this extraordinary belief was
given by Dr. Engelbert Kæmpfer,<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c017'><sup>[338]</sup></a> who was connected with the
Dutch embassy to Japan from 1690 to 1696, and since that time it has
been referred to by many travelers in the Malay Archipelago.</p>

<p class='c013'>A correspondent in the time-honored “Notes and Queries,” 20th
September, 1862, writes:</p>

<p class='c020'>Nearly five years ago, while staying with friends in Pulo Penang (Straits
of Malacca), I was shown by the wife of a prominent merchant five small
pearls, which had increased and multiplied in her possession. She had set
them aside for about 12 months in a small wooden box, packed in soft cotton
and with half a dozen grains of common rice. On opening the box at the expiration
of that time, she found four additional pearls, about the size of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>small pinhead and of much beauty, which I saw and examined not long after
the lady made the discovery. While my story may be received with laughter,
I can most solemnly assure you of the truth of my having seen these pearls,
and I have not the slightest doubt of the perfect truthfulness of the lady who
possessed them. I questioned an eminent Malay merchant of Penang on this
subject, and he assured me that one of his daughters had once possessed a similar
growth of pearls.<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c017'><sup>[339]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Notwithstanding the apparent absurdity of this pearl-breeding
theory, belief in it appears to be not only sincere but wide-spread, as
can be attested by any one familiar with affairs in the archipelago. A
critical examination into the matter was made in 1877 by Dr. N. B.
Dennys, curator of the Raffles Museum at Singapore, the result of
which was communicated to the Straits branch of the Royal Asiatic
Society, 28th February, 1878.<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c017'><sup>[340]</sup></a> From his numerous quotations of persons
who gave the results of their experiences we extract two instances.
One gentleman had 120 small pearls in addition to the five
breeding ones with which the experiment had started twenty years
before, and during the entire period the box had not been molested except
that it was opened occasionally for inspection by interested persons.
Another experimentor inclosed three breeding pearls with a
few grains of rice on 17th July, 1874; on opening the box on 14th July,
1875, nine additional pearls were discovered, and the three original
ones appeared larger.</p>

<p class='c013'>The belief has many curious variations. It is stated that in Borneo
and the adjacent islands, many of the fishermen reserve every ninth
pearl regardless of its size, and put the collection in a small bottle
which is kept corked with a dead man’s finger. According to Professor
Kimmerly, nearly every burial-place along the Borneo coast has
been desecrated in searching for “corks” for these bottles, and almost
every hut has its dead-finger bottle, with from ten to fifty “breeding
pearls” and twice that number of rice grains.<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c017'><sup>[341]</sup></a> A correspondent at
Sandakan, North Borneo, writes that at the time of his death at Hongkong
in 1901, Dr. Dennys had in his possession a small box containing
“breeding pearls”; but these disappeared after his death, and his
brother, the crown solicitor, was unable to find them. This correspondent
also states that the Ranee of Sarawak, a British protectorate
in western Borneo, has a collection of “breeding pearls” numbering
about two hundred, and that this is the only large collection known at
present.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>As contrasted with abundant and unquestionably sincere testimony
that pearls do “breed,” it may be stated that absolutely no result has
followed one or two native experiments made under supervision.
While it must be admitted that negative evidence is always weaker
than positive, and twenty failures would be outweighed by one successful
experiment, yet the scientific objections to the possibility of pearls
“breeding” cannot be overcome. The phenomenon is doubtless one of
those curiosities of natural history in which some important factor
has been overlooked.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another curious theory is that peculiar pearls continue to grow
after removal from the mollusk in which they originate. Quite recently
it was reported from New Durham, North Carolina, that a
pearl found there in 1896 had been growing continually since it was
found and removed from the water. Unfortunately, it was weighed
only when the last observation was made, and its increased size doubtless
existed only in the imagination of its possessor.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the first chapter of this book, reference was made to the Atharvaveda,
dating from at least 2400 years ago, and its allusion to the use
of an amulet of pearl shell and of pearls among the Hindus in bestowing
long life and prosperity upon young Brahmanical disciples. As this
amulet is fastened upon the youth, the following hymn is recited, according
to this ancient Veda of the Atharvans:</p>

<p class='c013'>The mystical Taoists, in their pursuit of immortality, made much of
pearls as an important ingredient in formulæ for perpetuating youth.
According to an old Taoist authority, in preparing one of these elixirs,
an extra long pearl which has been worn for many years is steeped
in some infusion of malt, or a preparation of serpents’ gall, honeycomb,
and pumice-stone. When the pearl becomes plastic, it is drawn
out to the length of two or three feet, cut into suitable lengths, and
formed into pills, the taking of which renders food thenceforth unnecessary.<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c017'><sup>[343]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The myth of the dragon and the pearl has been a far-reaching theme
of the artists in Japan and China, whether in color, metal, or stone.
There has been much written as to how the myth became so fixed in
the minds of the Orientals, and Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, who has
made an exhaustive study of the myth of the dragon in all its phases,
has very courteously communicated to us the following facts. Personally
he had never been able to learn of a true or clear description
of the origin of the myth other than the well-recorded legend given
by Legge in the “Sacred Books of the East” (Vol. XL, p. 211), in which
there is a quotation from Shuangtze, a writer of the fourth century
before Christ, who says: “Near the Ho river there was a poor man,
who supported his family by weaving rushes. His son, when diving
in a deep pool, found a pearl worth a thousand ounces of silver. The
father said: ‘Bring a stone and beat it in pieces. A pearl of this value
must have been in a pool nine khung deep and under the chin of the
black dragon. That you were able to get it must have been owing to
your having found him asleep. Let him awake, and the consequences
will not be small.’” Prince Rupprecht says:</p>

<p class='c020'>This legend has nothing to do with the illustration to which you refer; it
belongs to a cycle of myths concerning a stone in the head of a serpent, or the
crown of the king of the serpents or dragons; myths which also exist in
Germany since the days of old. I should rather be inclined to think that the
commonly accepted pearl between the two dragons is not a pearl at all. At
least this pearl is always surrounded by ornaments in the shape of flames or
claws, and Professor Hirth discovered on such a representation in woodcut,
an explanation of the flames by the sign for Yangsui, a very ancient kind of
metallic mirrors, of concave form, that were used to produce the heavenly fire.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>This explanation is probably erroneous and due to a misunderstanding of
the signs for flames. In my opinion, another explanation, that the pearl is not
really a pearl but a spider, is nearer to the truth. As an argument in favor of
this theory the following sentence may be quoted from an encyclopedia of the
eleventh century (“Pieu-tzi-lei,” chap. 223): “The pearl of a fish is its eye,
the pearl of a tortoise is its foot, the pearl of the spider is its belly.” Pearl, as
well as spider, are both called in Chinese by the same word but are written in a
different way.</p>

<p class='c020'>I, for my part, believe that the pearl is the belly not indeed of a spider, but
of Garuda, the eagle of Vishnu, known in the old Hindu mythology as the
foe of the Vagas, beings with human bodies and the tails of serpents. At
least, I found on an old Chinese gateway, dating back to the times of the
Mongol emperors, a sculpture showing the contest between Garuda and the
Vagas. On another sculpture of the late King epoch the Vagas are already
changed into dragons, and the wings, the limbs and the head of Garuda have
become quite insignificant, while his belly is prominent like a ball.</p>

<p class='c013'>A beautiful metaphor occurs in ancient Chinese writings, in the
Book of the Later Han,<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c017'><sup>[344]</sup></a> for instance, which regards this gem as the
hidden soul of the oyster.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is no end of legends and myths regarding the pearl in oriental
literature. One fable credits it with a peculiar magical power: by
speaking the right word, a spirit can be called therefrom which makes
the owner a possessor of all the happiness of the earth. Browning
notes this in two exquisite stanzas, “A Pearl, a Girl,” published on the
day of his death in 1889, in which he compares this characteristic with
a woman’s love called forth by the mystic word.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>In the folk-song of Servia is a pretty little poem which testifies to
the love they bear to pearls:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A youth unmated prays to God,</div>
      <div class='line'>To turn him to pearls in the sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the maidens come to fill their urns;</div>
      <div class='line'>That so they might gather him into their laps,</div>
      <div class='line'>And string him on a fine green thread,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wear him pendant from the neck;</div>
      <div class='line'>That he might hear what each one said,</div>
      <div class='line'>And whether his loved one spoke of him.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His prayer was granted and he lay</div>
      <div class='line'>Turned to pearls in the dark blue sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the maidens come to fill their urns;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then quickly they gather him into their laps,</div>
      <div class='line'>And string him on a green silk thread,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wear him pendant from the neck;</div>
      <div class='line'>So he hears what each one says of her own</div>
      <div class='line'>And what his loved one says of him.<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c017'><sup>[345]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the days when romance and chivalry held sway in Europe,
pearls and other favors were presented by ladies for the brave knights
to wear at tournaments. And we are told in the Arthurian legends
how Elaine, “the lily maid of Astolat,” gave to Sir Lancelot “a red
sleeve of scarlet, embroidered with great pearls,” for him to wear
on his helmet: and “then to her tower she climbed and took the shield,
there kept it and so lived in fantasy”; while he fought and won at the
tilt, “wearing her scarlet sleeve, tho’ carved and cut, and half the
pearls away.”<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c017'><sup>[346]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The sweet sentiment of purity associated with the pearl ennobles it
above all other gems. Rabanus Maurus, archbishop of Mainz, wrote,
about 850, that “mystically, the pearl signifies the hope of the Kingdom
of Heaven, or charity and the sweetness of celestial life.”<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c017'><sup>[347]</sup></a> True,
it was not among the twelve gems which adorned the breastplate of
the high priest of the Temple, symbolical of the twelve apostles. A
Father of the Church—St. Augustine, we believe—explains this by
saying that it was reserved for a more sacred office, that of representing
Christ himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearl signifies purity, innocence, humility, and a retiring spirit. All
stones of the gray color of the pearl have the significances which are
given to this beautiful gem.<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c017'><sup>[348]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Unlike other gems, the pearl comes to us perfect and beautiful,
direct from the hand of nature. Other precious stones receive careful
treatment from the lapidary, and owe much to his art. The pearl,
however, owes nothing to man. Perhaps this has much to do with the
sentiments we cherish for it. It touches us with the same sense of simplicity
and sweetness as the mountain daisy or the wild rose. It is
absolutely a gift of nature, on which man cannot improve. We turn
from the brilliant, dazzling ornament of diamonds or emeralds to a
necklace of pearls with a sense of relief, and the eye rests upon it with
quiet, satisfied repose and is delighted with its modest splendor, its soft
gleam, borrowed from its home in the depths of the sea. It seems truly
to typify steady and abiding affection, which needs no accessory or
adornment to make it more attractive. And there is a purity and
sweetness about it which makes it especially suitable for the maiden.</p>

<p class='c013'>The idea of pearly purity is inseparably linked with the name
Margaret, derived from the Persian <i>Murwari</i> (pearl, or child of light)
through the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μαργαρίτης</span>. This name—beautiful in sound as
well as in origin—is popular in all European countries, and likewise
are its abbreviations and diminutives: in Italian, Margherita and Rita;
in French, Marguerite, Margot, and Groten; in German, Margarethe,
Gretchen, and Grethel; and in English, Margaret, Marjorie, Madge,
Maggie, Peggy, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>The use of the word as a proper name among the early Christians
was doubtless suggested by the sweet simplicity and loveliness of the
pearl, and by the beautiful symbolical references to this gem in the
Scriptures; and the meaning of the name has been strengthened by the
pure lives and the good deeds of the many beautiful Margarets in all
lands, including the virgin martyr, St. Margaret of Antioch, “the mild
maid of God” referred to in the Liturgy, who, before the fifth century,
was the embodiment of feminine innocence and faith overcoming evil,
and who is often represented wearing a string of pearls; also St. Margaret
Ætheling of the eleventh century, who endeared the name in
Scotland, was canonized in 1215, and was adopted as the patron saint
of Scotland in 1673; and Margaret, “Pearl of Bohemia,” so beloved
by the Danes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Especially among the Germans has the name a tender significance;
with them it is symbolical of maidenly sweetness and purity associated
with richness of womanhood, such as was typified by Goethe in the
heroine of his “Faust.” This idea may have impelled Wordsworth in
the selection of a name for the lovely, girlish character in his “Excursion”;
and Tennyson for his “Sweet pale Margaret,” and likewise
Scott for “Ladye Margaret, the flower of Teviot.” With the memory
of these lives and characters before her, many a loving mother has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>crystallized the hope entertained for a baby daughter by enriching
her with this beautiful name.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poets seem never to tire of using the pearl as a symbol of perfection
in form, in purity, in luster, and in sweetness. But probably none has
made a more lovely comparison than Owen Meredith:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>As pure as a pearl,</div>
      <div class='line'>And as perfect: a noble and innocent girl.<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c017'><sup>[349]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The Oriental poets unite with those of the West in their love for this
gem, and those gifted writers are lavish in its use. Let us but add the
lament of Shabl Abdullah on the death of Nozami:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Nozami’s gone, our fairest pearl is lost.</div>
      <div class='line'>From purest dew, kind Heaven had given her birth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And then had fashioned her the pearl supreme.</div>
      <div class='line'>She softly shone, but hidden from mankind,</div>
      <div class='line'>So God has now restored her to her shell.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Far more crude, but possibly equally pathetic, is that old epitaph
from Yorkshire, England:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In shells and gold pearls are not kept alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>A Margaret here lies beneath a stone.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the seventeenth century, Pierre de Rosnel wrote in a burst of
enthusiasm:</p>

<p class='c020'>The pearl is a jewel so perfect that its excellent beauty demands the love
and esteem of the whole universe. Suidas expresses himself in regard to it
thus: “The possession of the pearl is one of love’s greatest delights; the delight
of possessing it suffices to feed love.” In a painting, Philostratus, who had
the same ideas, has represented cupids with bows enriched with pearls; and
the ancients were all agreed to dedicate the pearl to Venus. Now, to my
thinking, the reason for their so doing was, that inasmuch as this goddess of
love, the fairest of all divinities, is descended from heaven and is formed of
the sea, so in like manner the pearl—the loveliest of all gems—is formed in
the sea and is the offspring of the dew of heaven. But he that would learn
more of the excellence of the pearl, let him inquire of the ladies, who will
relate much more in its praise than I can write, and who will doubtless confess
that nothing else so well adorns them.<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c017'><sup>[350]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Emblematic as the pearl is of maidenly purity and sweetness, it is
deemed especially appropriate as a wedding gift. This use dates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>from the earliest dawn of Hindu civilization, when the beloved Krishna
drew it from the sea to decorate his beautiful daughter on her nuptial
day. And among the Hindus not uncommonly the presentation
of a virgin pearl and its piercing forms part of the marriage ceremony.
In most of the European royal weddings in recent years, pearls
have been prominent among the bridal gifts; nor have they been
overlooked among the presents to American brides, including one
much in the public print about 1906, for whom a necklace of them was
selected by a neighboring republic as an appropriate present.</p>

<p class='c013'>The dedication of the pearl to love and marriage appears to have
been recognized by the artistic Greeks. One of the choicest engravings
preserved from classic times is a magnificent sardonyx showing
the marriage of Cupid and Psyche, in which the lovers are united by
what some authorities consider a string of pearls—emblematic of conjugal
bonds—by means of which the god Hymen leads them to the
nuptial couch.<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c017'><sup>[351]</sup></a> This engraved gem now forms one of the choicest
objects in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, having been purchased at
the sale of the Marlborough gems, London, 1898, at a cost of about
$10,000.</p>

<p class='c013'>And yet in Western countries the ill omen of pearls as bridal ornaments
has been widely recognized, these determining the tears that
will be shed in the married life. As Milton says, referring to the
Marchioness of Winchester:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And those pearls of dew she wears,</div>
      <div class='line'>Prove to be presaging tears.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It was told that when the Empress Eugénie of France was finishing
her toilet preparatory to her wedding in Notre Dame in 1853, a personal
attendant reminded her of the omen, and begged that she refrain
from wearing her pearl necklace on that occasion. Eugenie paid no
heed to the warning and wore the beautiful jewels just the same; and,
as all the world knows, her life has been one long tragedy. Since that
necklace was a lengthy one, containing very many pearls, the bride
who wears only a few on her wedding day need not dread the adage so
much, for, unfortunately, no woman’s life is wholly free from grief;
and most brides would doubtless risk a few tears rather than refuse to
wear a wedding gift of pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a very old idea that to dream of pearls betokens tears. A
suggestion of this occurs in John Webster’s “Duchess of Malfi”
(1623), Act III, sc. 5:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span><i>Duchess</i>: I had a very strange dream to-night;</div>
      <div class='line in11'>Methought I wore my coronet of state,</div>
      <div class='line in11'>And on a sudaine all the diamonds</div>
      <div class='line in11'>Were chang’d to pearles.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Antonio</i>: My interpretation</div>
      <div class='line in11'>Is, you’ll weepe shortly;</div>
      <div class='line in11'>For to me the pearles</div>
      <div class='line in11'>Doe signifie your teares.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And we quote also from “The Parson’s Wedding” (1663), Act II,
sc. 5, where Jolly exclaims: “What! in thy dumps, brother? The captain
sad! ’Tis prophetic. I’d as lieve have dreamt of pearl, or the
loss of my teeth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Tradition relates that Queen Margaret Tudor, wife of James IV of
Scotland, just before the battle of Flodden Field (1513), had many
fears as to the disastrous issue of that conflict, owing to having
dreamed on three nights in succession that all her jewels were suddenly
turned into pearls. This was interpreted as a sign of coming
widowhood and sorrow, which was soon verified; and a similar story
is told of Marie de’ Medici shortly before the murder of Henry IV of
France in 1610.</p>

<p class='c013'>The employment of pearls medicinally dates from an ancient period.
This use is mentioned in the oldest existing Sanskrit medical work, the
“Charaka-Samhita,”<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c017'><sup>[352]</sup></a> composed early in the Christian era; and likewise
in the somewhat more modern “Susruta,”<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c017'><sup>[353]</sup></a> which probably originated
before the eighth century.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is particularly in Oriental countries that therapeutic properties
have been credited to pearls. The powder of these gems has been rated
very highly there, and is still used to some extent. It was considered
beneficial in cases of ague, indigestion, and hemorrhages, and was regarded
as possessing stimulative qualities. Medical literature of the
Orient contains many accounts of the uses of pearls and of the methods
of forming them into pills, ointments, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to a treatise written by Narahari, a physician of Kashmir,
about 1240 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, the pearl cures diseases of the eyes, is an antidote
to poisons, cures consumption and morbid disturbances, and increases
strength and general health.<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c017'><sup>[354]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In China, as well as in other Asiatic countries, a distinction was
made in the therapeutic effects of so-called “virgin” pearls and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>those pierced or bored for stringing. The Chinese natural history of
Li Shi Chin, completed about 1596, states that bored pearls will not
serve for medicine, for which unpierced ones should be used. It
further adds that the taste is saltish, sweetish, and cold; and that they
benefit the liver, clear the eyes, and cure deafness. Dr. T. Nishikawa
informs us that at the present time many Mytilus seed-pearls are exported
from Japan to China for medicinal purposes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Quoting principally from Ahmed Teifashi, Whitelow Ainslie wrote
in 1825 that Arabian physicians suppose the powder of the pearl to
have virtues in weak eyes; and they credit it with efficacy in palpitations,
nervous tremors, melancholia, and hemorrhage. Also they
have this strange notion, that when applied externally and while in the
shell, it cures leprosy.<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c017'><sup>[355]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Statements of the curative properties of pearls come also from
Japan at a somewhat recent date. The catalogue of the National
Exhibition at Yedo in 1877, Part V, page 78, notes that they soothe the
heart, lessen phlegm, are an antidote to poison, and cure fever, smallpox,
and blear-eyedness.</p>

<p class='c013'>The popular modern idea in India as to the therapeutic value was
thus expressed by a native prince, Sourindro Mohun Tagore, Mus.
Doc., the Maharajah of Tagore, in 1881:</p>

<p class='c020'>The use of pearls conduces to contentment of mind and to strength of body
and soul. The burnt powder of this gem, if taken with water as sherbet, cures
vomiting of blood of all kinds. It prevents evil spirits working mischief in
the minds of men, takes off bad smell from the mouth, cures lunacy of all
descriptions and all mental diseases, jaundice and all diseases of the heart, intestines
and stomach. Burnt pearl mixed with water and taken into the
nostrils, as a powder, takes away headsickness, cures cataract, lachryma and
swelling of the eyes, the painful sensation such as is caused by the entry of
sand into them, and ulcers. Used as a dentifrice, it strengthens the gums and
cleanses the teeth. Rubbed on the body with other medicines, it cures all skin
diseases. It stops bleeding from cuts and ultimately heals them up. Whether
taken internally or externally, it is a sure antidote to poison. It drives away
all imaginary fears and removes all bodily pain. To prevent its tendency to
affect the brain, it should always be used with the burnt powder of basud, and
in its absence with that of white mother-of-pearl. The dose of pearl-powder
should not exceed 2¼ mashas [19.68 grs.].<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c017'><sup>[356]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The Hindus credited specific virtues to pearls of different colors:
the yellow brought wealth, the honey shade fostered understanding,
the white attracted fame, and the blue, good luck. Defective pearls
caused leprosy, loss of fortune, disgrace, insanity, and death, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>to the degree of defect. The “Mani-málá,” previously quoted, states
that “pearls possessed of every valuable quality shield their master
from every evil, and suffer nothing harmful to come near him. The
house which contains a perfect pearl the ever-restless Lakshmi (goddess
of wealth) chooses to make her dwelling for ever and a day.”<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c017'><sup>[357]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A similar idea is expressed in an old Hindu treatise on gems by
Buddhabhatta, where we read: “The pearl from the shell ought always
to be worn as an amulet by those who desire prosperity.”<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c017'><sup>[358]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls still find a place in the pharmacopœia of India. One of the
latest standard works, that of R. N. Khory and N. N. Katrak,<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c017'><sup>[359]</sup></a> credits
the powder as a stimulant, tonic, and aphrodisiac. It is one of the ingredients
in numerous Indian prescriptions used in curing impotence,
heart-disease, consumption, etc. According to these authorities, the
dose is from one fourth to one half grain of the powdered pearl.</p>

<p class='c013'>Owing to the high cost of sea pearls, even those of the smallest
size, a substitute for medicinal and similar purposes is found in the
Placuna pearls of Ceylon, Borneo, etc. These are of such slight luster
that only the choicest are of ornamental value, consequently they are
sold at relatively small prices. A considerable demand exists for them
to be placed in the mouths of deceased Hindus of the middle class, instead
of the sea pearls which are used by the wealthy, or the rice which
is employed in a similar manner by persons of poorer rank. This custom
seems to be analogous to that of the ancient Britons, and also to
that of the American Indians, in depositing food and other requisites
for a journey in burial graves. The practice is an old one in India and
was noted by Marco Polo more than six hundred years ago.</p>

<p class='c013'>Most of the Placuna pearls are calcined and are used with areca-nuts
and betel-pepper leaves in a very popular masticatory, one of the “seven
sisters of sleep,” which is to the Hindu what opium is to the Chinaman,
or tobacco to the American or European. The hard white areca-nut
(<i>Areca Catechu</i>) is about the size and shape of a hen’s egg. Three or
four thousand tons of the small, tender nuts are annually shipped from
Ceylon to India for this masticatory, which is chewed by a hundred
million persons. After boiling in water, pellets of them are placed in
a leaf of the betel-pepper (<i>Piper betle</i>) with a small quantity of lime
made from pearls or shells, according to the desired quality and value
of product. It is credited with hardening the gums, sweetening the
breath, aiding digestion, and stimulating the nervous system like coffee
or tobacco; its most visible effect is tingeing the saliva and blackening
the teeth, which is far from attractive, especially in an otherwise beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>woman. A more recent use for these Placuna pearls is as an
ingredient in a proprietary face powder and enamel, which is marketed
in Europe.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not alone the Orientals that have found medicinal virtues in
pearls. Even in Europe they have occupied a prominent place in materia
medica, especially during the Middle Ages when a knowledge of the
occult properties of gems was an important branch of learning. Indeed,
they could scarcely have been overlooked by people who at one
time or another swallowed pretty much everything, from dried snake’s
eyes to the filings of a murderer’s irons, in their quest for the unusual
and costly with which to relieve and comfort themselves. During the
Middle Ages in Europe, writers who gave attention to pearls, as well
as to other gems, treated almost exclusively of their reputed efficacy in
magic and in medicine; and most of the accounts from the ninth to
the fourteenth century seem wholly without scientific value, and at
times reach the climax of extravagance and absurdity in their claims
for the wonderful potency of the gem.</p>

<p class='c013'>Albertus Magnus, the Dominican scholar born in Germany in the
twelfth century, wrote that pearls were used in mental diseases, in
affections of the heart, in hemorrhages, and dysentery.<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c017'><sup>[360]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The “Lapidario” of Alfonso X of Castile (1221–1284), called “The
Wise,” the father of the Spanish language, states:</p>

<p class='c020'>The pearl is most excellent in the medicinal art, for it is of great help in
palpitation of the heart, and for those who are sad or timid, and in every sickness
which is caused by melancholia, because it purifies the blood, clears it and
removes all its impurities. Therefore, the physicians put them in their
medicine and lectuaries, with which they cure these infirmities, and give them
to be swallowed. They also make powders of them, which are applied to the
eyes; because they clear the sight wonderfully, strengthen the nerves and dry
up the moisture which enters the eyes.<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c017'><sup>[361]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Anselmus de Boot, physician to Emperor Rudolph II, and one of the
great authorities at the beginning of the seventeenth century, gave the
following directions for making “<i>aqua perlata</i>, which is most excellent
for restoring the strength and almost for resuscitating the dead. Dissolve
the pearls in strong vinegar, or better in lemon juice, or in spirits
of vitriol or sulphur, until they become liquified; fresh juice is then
added and the first decanted. Then, to the milky and turbid solution,
add enough sugar to sweeten it. If there be four ounces of this solution,
add an ounce each of rose-water, of tincture of strawberries, of
borage flowers and of balm and two ounces of cinnamon water. When
you wish to give the medicine, shake the mixture so that the sediment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>may be swallowed at the same time. From one ounce to an ounce and
a half may be taken, and nothing more excellent can be had. In pernicious
and pestilential fevers, the ordinary <i>aqua perlata</i> cannot be compared
to this. Care must be taken to cover the glass carefully while
the pearls are dissolving, lest the essence should escape.”<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c017'><sup>[362]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A curious book on the medicinal use of pearls was written in 1637
by Malachias Geiger,<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c017'><sup>[363]</sup></a> in which he especially praises the efficacy of
Bavarian pearls. It was true that their material value was less than
that of oriental pearls, but this was compensated by their therapeutic
qualities. He had accomplished many cures of a very serious disease
and had used these pearls successfully in cases of epilepsy, insanity,
and melancholia.</p>

<p class='c013'>Quotations might be given from a hundred medieval writers as to
the therapeutics of pearls. The diseases for which they were recommended,
as noted by Robert Lovell’s “Panmineralogicon, or Summe of
all Authors,” published at Oxford in 1661, seems to have included a
large portion of the entire list known at that period. This summary
states:</p>

<p class='c020'>Pearls strengthen and confirme the heart; they cherish the spirits and principall
parts of the body; being put into collyries, they cleanse weafts of the
eyes, and dry up the water thereof, help their filth, and strengthen the nerves
by which moisture floweth into them; they are very good against melancholick
griefes; they helpe those that are subject to cardiack passions; they defend
against pestilent diseases, and are mixed with cordiall remedies; they are good
against the lienterie, that is, the flux of the belly, proceeding from the sliperiness
of the intestines, insomuch that they cannot retaine the meat, but let it
passe undigested; they are good against swounings; they help the trembling
of the heart and giddinesse of the head; they are mixed with the <i>Manus
Christi</i> against fainting (called <i>Manus Christi perlata</i> in the London <i>Pharmacopaea</i>);
they are put into antidotes or corroborating powders; they help
the flux of bloud; they stop the terms, and cleanse the teeth; they are put into
antidotes for the bowels, and increase their vertue, make the bloud more thin,
and clarify that which is more thick and feculent; they help feavers. The <i>oile
of Pearles</i> or unions helpeth the resolution of the nerves, convulsion, decay of
old age, phrensie, keepeth the body sound, and recovereth it when out of order,
it rectifieth womens milk, and increaseth it, corrects the vices of the natural
parts and seed. It cureth absesses, eating ulcers, the cancer and hemorrhoides....
The best are an excellent cordial, by which the oppressed balsame
of life and decayed strength are recreated and strengthened, therefore
they resist poyson, the plague, and putrefaction, and exhilarate, and therefore
they are used as the last remedie in sick persons.<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c017'><sup>[364]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>So powerful and mysterious were their alleged virtues, that in some
instances it was necessary only that the pearls be worn to make effective
their prophylaxis against disease. This belief was by no means confined
to the ignorant and inexperienced, for we are told that even Pope
Adrian was never without his amulet made of the extraordinary combination
of oriental pearls, a dried toad, etc.<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c017'><sup>[365]</sup></a> Leonardo, in the
fifteenth century, wrote that pearls render true and virtuous all who
wear them.<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c017'><sup>[366]</sup></a> Although we wonder at what we call the superstitions
of the Middle Ages, perchance future generations will smile at many
of our mistaken follies.</p>

<p class='c013'>A prominent historical instance of administering pearls medicinally
was in the treatment of Charles VI of France (1368–1422), to whom
pearl powder mixed with distilled water was given for the cure of
insanity.</p>

<p class='c013'>A far more illustrious patient was Lorenzo de’ Medici, “The Magnificent”
(1448–1492), the celebrated ruler of Florence. When this
plebeian prince lay dying of a fever at Careggi, just after that famous
interview with Savonarola, his friends called in Lazaro da Ticino, a
physician of reputation, who administered pulverized pearls. Politian,
who was present, is credited with the statement that when the medicine
was administered, to the inquiry as to how it tasted, Lorenzo replied:
“As pleasant as anything can be to a dying man.”<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c017'><sup>[367]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Even the English philosopher, Francis Bacon (1561–1626), mentioned
pearls among medicines for the prolongation of life. He adds:
“Pearls are taken, either in a fine powder or in a kind of paste or solution
made by the juice of very sour and fresh lemons. Sometimes they
are given in aromatic confections, sometimes in a fluid form. Pearls
no doubt have some affinity with the shells wherein they grow; perhaps
may have nearly the same qualities as the shells of crawfish.”<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c017'><sup>[368]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Powdered pearl or mother-of-pearl mixed with lemon juice was used
as a wash for the face, and was considered “the best in the world.”<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c017'><sup>[369]</sup></a>
The pearl powder and lemon juice were permitted to stand for a day
or two and the combination was then filtered before using. Another
method of preparing this was:</p>

<p class='c020'>Dissolve two or three ounces of fine seed-pearl in distilled vinegar, and
when it is perfectly dissolved, pour the vinegar into a clean basin; then drop
some oil of tartar upon it, and it will cast down the pearl into fine powder; then
pour the vinegar clean off softly; put to the pearl clear conduit or spring
water; pour that off, and do so often until the taste of the vinegar and tartar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>be clean gone; then dry the powder of pearl upon warm embers, and keep it
for your use.<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c017'><sup>[370]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Through their composition of carbonate of lime, pearls possibly possess
some slight therapeutic value, which, however, can easily be supplied
by other materials—as the shell, for instance—and is entirely out
of proportion to their market value as ornaments.</p>

<p class='c013'>Although pearls have lost their therapeutic prestige and no longer
have a recognized place in materia medica, their healing qualities are
not to be denied, for there are few ills to which women are subject that
cannot be bettered or at least endured with greater patience when the
sufferer receives a gift of pearls; the truth of which any doubting
Thomas may easily verify in his own household to the limit of his
purse-strings.</p>

<p class='c013'>Owing to their beauty and great value, pearls have been deemed
particularly appropriate as a sacrifice in enriching a drink for a toast
or tribute. Shakspere alludes to this in the words of King Claudius,
the pearl being frequently designated <i>union</i> in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The king shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath;</div>
      <div class='line'>And in the cup an union shall he throw,</div>
      <div class='line'>Richer than that which four successive kings</div>
      <div class='line'>In Denmark’s crown have worn.<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c017'><sup>[371]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is stated that a pearl worth £15,000 was reduced to powder and
drunk by Sir Thomas Gresham, the English merchant, in the presence
of the Spanish ambassador, as a tribute to Queen Elizabeth, by whom
he had been knighted.<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c017'><sup>[372]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The most celebrated instance of enriching a drink with a pearl was
doubtless Cleopatra’s tribute to Antony, Pliny’s account of which we
give in the words of old Philemon Holland:</p>

<p class='c020'>This princesse, when <i>M. Antonius</i> had strained himselfe to doe her all the
pleasure he possibly could, and had feasted her day by day most sumptuously,
and spared for no cost: in the hight of her pride and wanton braverie (as
being a noble courtezan, and a queene withall) began to debase the expense
and provision of Antonie, and made no reckoning of all his costly fare.
When he thereat demanded againe how it was possible to goe beyond this
magnificence of his, she answered againe, that she would spend upon him at
one supper ten million Sestertij. <i>Antonie</i> laid a great wager with her about it,
and shee bound it againe, and made it good. The morrow after, <i>Cleopatra</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>made <i>Antonie</i> a supper which was sumptuous and roiall ynough: howbeit,
there was no extraordinarie service seene upon the board: whereat <i>Antonius</i>
laughed her to scorne, and by way of mockerie required to see a bill with the
account of the particulars. She again said, that whatsoever had been served
up alreadie was but the overplus above the rate and proportion in question,
affirming still that she would yet in that supper make up the full summe that
she was seazed at: yea, herselfe alone would eat above that reckoning, and her
owne supper should cost 60 million Sestertij: and with that commanded the
second service to be brought in. The servitors set before her one only crewet
of sharpe vineger, the strength whereof is able to resolve pearles. Now she had
at her eares hanging these two most precious pearles, the singular and only
jewels of the world, and even Natures wonder. As <i>Antonie</i> looked wistly upon
her, shee tooke one of them from her eare, steeped it in the vineger, and so
soon as it was liquified, dranke it off. And as she was about to doe the like
by the other, <i>L. Plancius</i> the judge of that wager, laid fast hold upon it with
his hand, and pronounced withal, that <i>Antonie</i> had lost the wager.<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c017'><sup>[373]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Elsewhere has been set forth the impracticability of dissolving a
pearl in a glass of vinegar without first pulverizing it.<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c017'><sup>[374]</sup></a> It seems
probable that if Pliny’s interesting story has any foundation, Cleopatra
might have swallowed a solid pearl in a glass of wine—certainly a
more pleasing draught as well as a more graphic sacrifice; and we
should accept its reported value with a grain of salt, for it would
scarcely have been safe for the court gossip to belittle the value of this
tribute of love.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pliny, and other Roman writers, mention another instance, that of
Clodius “the sonne of Aesope the Tragedian Poet,” who took two
pearls of great price “in a braverie, and to know what tast pearles had,
mortified them in venegre, and drunke them up. And finding them to
content his palat wondrous well, because he would not have all the
pleasure by himselfe, and know the goodnesse thereof alone, he gave
to every guest at his table one pearle apeece to drinke in like manner.”<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c017'><sup>[375]</sup></a>
The chronicler fails to tell what the guests thought of the flavor of
pearls, or whether some would not have preferred them for a more
appropriate use.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>To trace the markets of the pearl is to trace the routes of commerce
from early times. The first routes from the Far East
seem to have been two: one by the Persian Gulf and the
Euphrates to Babylonia and Assyria, and thence by caravan
through Damascus to Tyre and Sidon; the other by the Red Sea and
Suez to Egypt. As regards the former route, Sir George Birdwood
furnishes positive evidence that the Phenicians visited India as early
as 2200 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> It seems highly probable that pearls were introduced
by this route at an early period, although it is difficult to find material
proof of the fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>By means of this commerce, the great ancient civilizations of
Phenicia, Mesapotamia and the Nile valley doubtless became familiar
with the gem treasures of eastern Asia. Then came the opening of
the Mediterranean with first “the great Sidon,” and later Tyre, as
the starting-points of commerce, exploration, and colonial settlement
among the islands and on the shores of what, to the Asiatic peoples,
was the great western sea. However, as the Greek islands and their
colonies developed, the Phenicians were more strictly confined to the
coasts of Africa and Spain. Gades, Tartessus, and Carthage were
their great colonies and trading-ports, and their adventurous sailors
passed on through the Straits of Gibraltar and directed their course
northward to the British Isles, where they very probably obtained the
pearls of the Scotch rivers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile, the campaigns of Alexander had carried Greek influence
and authority over all western Asia, reaching even to India itself,
and had led to a widely increased intercourse. Although he died at
the age of thirty-two, Alexander the Great did more than any single
individual in the world’s history to bring the nations of the Eastern
and the Western worlds into contact with each other, and it is certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>due to this circumstance that we find much greater evidences
of the use of pearls in the western countries after his time. Besides
this, the founding of Alexandria provided a mart, in whose bazaars
the traders of India, Persia, and Arabia bartered their treasured
gems, just as their descendants do in the same place at the present
day.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not, however, until the establishment of the Roman empire
that this commercial intercourse reached its highest development.
The Romans, with their marvelous capacity for organization, were
the first to build a great system of permanent and well-kept roads to
facilitate land travel and land traffic. These great roads, starting
from the Forum, reached out in every direction, even to the limits of
the empire; and, as a result of increased commercial activity, more
gems were engraved, mounted, and set during the five hundred years
of Rome’s commercial supremacy than during any other early epoch
of the world’s history.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Rome, the trade in pearls was so important that there was a corporation
of “margaritarii.” The <i>officinæ margaritariorum</i> were installed
in the Forum, in the neighborhood of the <i>tabernae argentariæ</i>;
some were also on the Via Sacra.<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c017'><sup>[376]</sup></a> However, the name <i>margaritarius</i>
did not only apply to the jewelers, merchants, and setters of pearls,
but also to those who fished for them and to the guardians of the gems
and jewels wherein pearls were used.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the fall of the Western empire, the Dark Ages settled down
like a cloud over Europe for five hundred years. Only among the
Saracens and at Byzantium did the culture of the old civilization survive,
and eventually the light of knowledge and of progress was rekindled
from these sources. The Crusades were the chief factors
in this new development; they gave a mighty stimulus, by means of
which Europe was aroused from her lethargy and once more brought
into contact with the Orient. Venice and Genoa now became the
great carriers, and from this time, and to this source, may be traced
many of the oriental gems in Europe. The Venetian fleet of three
hundred merchant ships brought the products of the East and distributed
them over Europe, by way of the German cities of Augsburg
and Nuremberg, where the great jewelers and silversmiths made
world-famed ornaments.</p>

<p>PECTORAL CROSS OF CONSTANTINE IX. MONOMACHUS (1000–1054 A.D.)<br /><br />Containing some wood attributed to the true cross.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>When Constantinople fell into the hands of the Turks, the treasures
of the Eastern empire were scattered throughout Europe; but, at the
same time, the establishment of the Turkish empire served to close the
way to India and the far East for the merchants and travelers of
Europe, and, hence, new means of access had to be sought by sea.
This, as is well known, was the cause of the voyages of De Gama
and Columbus. The unexpected result of these voyages—the discovery
of a new continent—ushered in the wonderful period of Spanish
and Portuguese development and their colonization of both the East
and the West Indies; and to this epoch belongs the introduction of
American pearls to the markets of Europe. The gradual decline of
the power of Spain and Portugal—largely owing to bigotry and to the
reckless exploitation of the regions under their control—brings us to
the beginning of the present phase of commercial intercourse in which
all the nations of the civilized world are engaged in varying proportion,
according to their power and aptitude. Never before have the
different regions of the earth been more closely in touch with each
other, and we may safely say that nothing is likely to occur which can
permanently interrupt the progressive development of the world’s
commerce.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the various means of transportation and locomotion that have
existed in the past twenty-three or twenty-four centuries, there is no
doubt that the commerce of pearls has varied more or less, but there
has ever been, in some part of the world, a great potentate, a great
collector or dealer who has influenced the finest gems to gravitate his
way. Never has there been a time when some person was not prepared
to encourage—and to richly encourage—the sale of fine jewels to him.
The history of the commerce of precious stones is a history of travel
and exploration, of hardship, pleasure, reward, and sometimes of
serious disappointment.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lesson we derive from these decorative objects of natural
beauty and softness—treasured alike by savage, barbarian, ancient
warrior, statesman, king, emperor, peasant, bourgeois, magyar, lady,
and queen—always carries with it the moral that the gifts of creation
are ever prized by some one in every age or place.</p>

<p class='c013'>The necessary qualifications affecting the value of a pearl are:
first, that it should be perfectly round, pear-shaped, drop-shaped,
egg-shaped, or button-shaped, and as even in form as though it were
turned on a lathe. It must have a perfectly clear skin, and a decided
color or tint, whether white, pink, creamy, gray, brown or
black. If white, it must not have a cloud or a blur or haze, nor should
the skin have the slightest appearance of being opaque or dead. It
must be absolutely free from all cracks, scratches, spots, flaws, indentations,
shadowy reflections or blemishes of any kind. It must
possess the peculiar luster or orient characteristic of the gem. The
skin must be unbroken, and not show any evidence of having been
polished.</p>

<p class='c013'>Diamonds and the more valuable precious stones generally are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>bought and sold by the weight called a carat. This carat, whatever
its precise value, is always considered as divisible into four diamond
or pearl grains, but the subdivisions of the carat are usually expressed
by the vulgar fractions, one fourth, one eighth, one twelfth, one sixteenth,
one twenty-fourth, one thirty-second, and one sixty-fourth.
The origin of the carat is to be sought in certain small, hard, leguminous
seeds, which, when dried, remain constant in weight. The
brilliant, glossy, scarlet-and-black seed of <i>Abrus precatorius</i> constitutes
the Indian rati, about three grains; the <i>Adenanthera pavonina</i>
seed weighs about four grains. The seed of the locust-tree, <i>Ceratonia
siliqua</i>, weighs on the average three and one sixth grains, and constitutes,
no doubt, the true origin of the carat.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c017'><sup>[377]</sup></a> of the more notable of these weight-units used for
precious stones and precious metals is the <i>candarin</i>, <i>condorine</i>, or <i>cantarai</i>,
also termed by the Chinese <i>fun</i> or <i>fan</i>, and by the south Indians
a <i>fanam</i>, and used all over the Indo-Chinese archipelago. This is by
origin a large lentil or pea of a pinkish color dotted with black, about
double the size of the <i>gonj</i>, and possessing the same quality of very
slight variability of weight when dried. It is probably a variety of the
same botanic genus or species as the <i>Abrus precatorius</i>. The value
when reduced to absolute standard became a subsidiary part or submultiple
of the weight of some local coin, rupee, or pagoda, or a
decimal fraction of some local tchen, as in China and Japan.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following derivation of the word carat is given by Grimm:
“Carat. Italian: <i>carato</i>; French: <i>carat</i>; Spanish and Portuguese:
<i>quilate</i>; Old Portuguese: <i>quirate</i>, from Arabic <i>qirat</i>, and this from
the Greek, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεράτιον</span>.”<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c017'><sup>[378]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The carat is not absolutely of the same value in all countries. Its
weight, as used for weighing the diamond, pearl, and other gemstones
in different parts of the world, is given in decimals of a gram,
by the majority of the authorities, as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>Assuming that the gram corresponds to 15.43235 English grains,
an English diamond carat will nearly equal 3.17 grains. It is, however,
spoken of as being equal to four grains, the grains meant being
“diamond” or “pearl” grains, and not ordinary troy or avoirdupois
grains. Thus a diamond or pearl grain is but .7925 of a true grain.
In an English troy ounce of 480 grains there are 151½ carats; and so
it will be seen that a carat is not indeed quite 3.17 grains, but something
like 3.1683168 grains, or less exactly, 3.168 grains. Further, if
we accept the equivalent in grains of one gram to be, as stated above,
15.43235, and if there be 151½ carats in a troy ounce of 480 grains,
it will follow that an English diamond carat is .205304 of a gram, not&nbsp;.205409, as commonly affirmed. The following exact equivalents, in
metric grams and grains troy, of the diamond carat as used in different
parts of the world in 1882, are given by Mr. Lowis d’A. Jackson:</p>

<p class='c013'>With the present system of diamond carats and pearl grains it is
necessary to keep two entirely different sets of weights or to resort to
troublesome calculations. The stock-book of a jeweler, at the present
time, will contain the following fractions, expressing the weight of
a single pearl: ½, ¼, ⅛, <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub>, <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>32</sub>, <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>64</sub>, when the weight could be much
better stated as <sup>6</sup>3⁄<sub>64</sub> of a carat. It requires but a glance to see how
much easier this would be. Certain dealers have therefore proposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>the use of sets of fractions arranged in a similar way. In this manner
a stock-book can be kept much more easily and with greater precision.
Others, again, have adopted a decimal notation of the fractions
of a carat, which is even more simple and feasible, since the
common fractions ½, ¼, ⅛, etc. can be expressed as .5, .25, .125, etc.,
of a carat, this being either a carat of .2053 of a gram or the English
carat of .20534 of a gram.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand, an agreement was arrived at, as the result of a
conference between the diamond merchants of London, Paris, and
Amsterdam, by which the uniform weight of a diamond carat was
fixed at&nbsp;.205 of a gram, making the pearl grain .05125 of a gram. This
standard, which was suggested in 1871, by a syndicate of Parisian jewelers,
goldsmiths, and others dealing in precious stones, was subsequently
(1877) confirmed. But there is still a lack of uniformity in
the standard by which diamonds and pearls are bought and sold, and
very serious discrepancies exist in the sets of carat weights turned out
by different makers, although the international carat is almost universally
used.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the International Congress of Weights and Measures held at
the World’s Fair at Chicago in 1893, the writer suggested that the
carat should consist of 200 milligrams, so that ½ of a carat would be
100 milligrams and ¼ of a grain would be 12.5 milligrams. This
would mean 5 carats or 20 grains to a French gram, and 5000 carats
or 20,000 pearl grains to a French kilogram. This would depreciate
the present diamond carat or pearl grain only about one per cent., and
it would do away with the needless series of carats and grains of the
many nationalities. It could be simply explained to any private individual
in any country, especially as there are only two countries
which do not use the metric system.</p>

<p class='c013'>This carat has been earnestly indorsed, its introduction advocated,
and its merits clearly shown, by M. Guilliame, of the French Bureau
des Arts et Metiers, whose energetic work has found a reasonable cooperation,
in this country as well as in Europe, in introducing what
will be a scientific, logical, comprehensive, and possibly the final and international
carat; and any ancient, obsolete, or foreign carat can be
readily reduced to this carat once the metric value of the former is
computed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Association of Diamond Merchants of Amsterdam has already,
to avoid confusion, fixed the value of the carat (17th October,
1890) at 1 kilogram = 4875 carats, or 1 carat = 3.16561 grains troy =
205.128 mg. One pearl grain = .7914 grains troy = 51.282 mg.; but
the association has decided that, in case of litigation, these values
shall be determined by appointed bureaus, which would express them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>in grams and milligrams, a most important and valuable decision, as
the gram and the milligram will always be known as weights of constant
value.</p>

<p class='c013'>In view of the difficulty of inducing the abolition of the carat in
different countries, the German Federation of Jewelers decided to
petition the imperial government for authority to use the carat, in
order that it might be legally recognized. Such a proposition not
being in accord with the German laws in force on the subject of the
metric system, it was proposed to substitute for the carats then in use
one carat only, weighing two hundred milligrams. This proposal was
very favorably received in trade circles and may be taken into consideration
by the International Committee of Weights and Measures.
The Commission des Instruments et Travaux, to which this proposition
was referred, recommended its adoption to the committee in the
following terms:</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Commission recognizes that it would be very desirable that the
unit of weight of precious stones (the carat) which varies in different
countries, should be made uniform, and should be reduced to the nearest
metric equivalent. The weight of 200 mg., which is very close to
the carat most in use (205.5 mg.), would seem to be the best for this
purpose. The Commission believes that there can be no objection to
this standard of 200 mg. being called ‘the metric carat’ in order to
facilitate the abolition of the old carat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This proposition, adopted at the meeting of the International Committee
on the 13th of April, was communicated to the more important
associations. The Chambre Syndicale de la Bijouterie, Joaillerie et
Orfèvrerie de Paris, and the Chambre Syndicale des Négotiants en
Diamants, Perles, Pierres Précieuses et des Lapidaires de Paris assured
the committee of their support of this measure.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following is the text of the resolution which was passed by both
the above associations in January, 1906:</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Council, recognizing the advantages which would result to the
international trade in precious stones from the use of a unit based on
the metric system, desires that the metric carat of 200 mg. be universally
adopted.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The German Federation of Jewelers passed the following resolution
in August, 1906:</p>

<p class='c013'>“The German Federation considers that it is both necessary and advantageous
to replace the old carat by the metric carat of 200 mg.; it
authorizes its president to approach the imperial government and the
International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and the foreign associations
in order that the metric carat may be introduced as soon as
possible in all countries.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>The Chamber of Commerce of Antwerp promised, in a letter dated
the 7th of December, 1906, to rescind a decision of 29th of April, 1895,
approving the adoption of a carat of 205.3 mg., when the metric carat
of 200 mg. should come into universal use in the markets.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Association of Jewelers and Goldsmiths of Prague formally
authorized the German Federation to act in its name, in order that the
reform should come about as soon as possible by international agreement,
and the Association of Goldsmiths of Copenhagen has declared
its willingness to support the reform. The Committee of Weights and
Measures in Belgium prepared a law for the adoption of the metric
carat in December, 1906.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Larking, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Melbourne,
Australia, has transmitted by letter of September 16, 1907, the following
resolution of the Association of Manufacturing Jewelers of the
Colony of Victoria:</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is desirable that the carat weight should be the same in all countries,
and our association approves a metric carat of 200 milligrams.”</p>

<p class='c013'>On October 16, 1907, the Association of Societies for the Protection
of Commerce in the United Kingdom passed the following resolution:</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Committee of the Association approves the attempt to urge the
adoption in all countries of an international carat of 200 milligrams,
and hopes that, in the interest of the unification of weights, it will
prove successful.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The fourth General Conference of Weights and Measures, held in
Paris in October, 1907, passed this resolution:</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Conference approves the proposition of the International Committee
and declares that it sees no infringement of the integrity of the
metric system in the adoption of the appellation ‘metric carat’ to designate
a weight of 200 milligrams for the commerce in diamonds,
pearls, and precious stones.”<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c017'><sup>[379]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The following resolution was passed by The Birmingham Jewelers’
and Silversmiths’ Association, January 23, 1908: “That the best
thanks of this Committee be conveyed to the Decimal Association
for the good work they are doing, and this Committee expresses the
hope that all countries will adopt an International Carat of 200 milligrams
in weight.” Finally, on March 11, 1908, the metric carat of
200 milligrams was adopted in Spain as the official carat for diamonds,
pearls, and precious stones.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls have become of so much importance to so many dealers that
a special form of weight has been proposed for them. This would
have a diamond form and not a square form, and it would be stamped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>“Grain” instead of “Carat.” Another set would be stamped in milligrams,
the regular milligram weight with the pearl fraction above it,
and they could even be made round so as better to designate the pearl.</p>

<p class='c013'>The great value of pearls has suggested the making of a gage,
called the Kunz gage, by means of which round pearls can be very
accurately measured. Pearls of a given weight and perfectly spherical
form have been weighed and then measured by this gage, and the
theoretical diameters as computed from the measurement of a single
pearl are in the majority of instances in exact accord with these actual
measurements, the occasional variations in the smaller pearls barely
exceeding the thousandth part of an inch. These discrepancies may be
due to imperceptible divergencies in sphericity or, possibly, to trifling
differences in specific gravity.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following table gives the diameters of round pearls by measurement,
from <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub> to 500 grains, in millimeters and inches:</p>

<p class='c013'>The new and finer analytical balances weigh to the tenth part of a
milligram, the two thousandth part of a carat, the five hundredth part
of a grain; but this is not necessary. If the 200–milligram carat were
used, the two hundredth part of a carat could readily be ascertained,
and then a short-beam, rapid-weighing balance would answer every
purpose and save much time for the dealer who must make many
weighings in the course of a day. In an office where thousands of
weighings were made in a month, the task was accomplished with such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>minute accuracy that the margin of error did not exceed one carat
during that time.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>mina</i>, the sixtieth part of the lesser Alexandrian talent of silver,
was divided by the Romans, when they occupied Egypt, into twelve
ounces (<i>unciae</i>), and, weighing as it did 5460 grains, it became the
predecessor of the European pounds of which the troy pound is a
type. If we may believe a Syrian authority, Anania of Shiraz, who
wrote in the sixth century, the carat or diamond weight was originally
formed from one of these ounces by taking the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>144</sub> part.<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c017'><sup>[380]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>We find in Murray<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c017'><sup>[381]</sup></a> that the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεράτιον</span> was originally identical
with the Latin siliqua, and was called the <i>siliqua Graeca</i>. As a measure
of weight and fineness the carat represents the Roman siliqua as <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>24</sub>
of the golden solidus of Constantine, which was ⅙ of an ounce, hence
the various values into which <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>24</sub> and <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>144</sub> enter, or originally entered.
As a measure of weight for diamonds and precious stones, it was
originally <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>144</sub> of an ounce or 3⅓ grains. It is stated in Hakluyt (Voy.
II, pp. 1, 225, 1598): “Those pearls are praised according to the
caracts which they weigh; every caract is four graines.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There have been at all times men who possessed a delicate touch or a
fine sense of feeling, but probably few men are living to-day who would
be able to accomplish the feat attributed to Julius Cæsar, namely, that of
estimating the weight of a pearl by simply holding it in his hand.
There are very few who can tell the weight of a pearl in this way, and
while the story may be historically interesting, it is rather dubious.</p>

<p class='c013'>To attempt to formulate a list of prices, comparative or otherwise,
of pearls, is almost an impossibility, as probably no two authors of the
past three centuries have ever seen the same lot of pearls, nor have
their estimates always been the same as to quality, rarity and value.</p>

<p class='c013'>As interesting statistics from an historical point of view, there will
be presented here a list of the values of pearls dating back some ten
centuries. That there always has existed a higher valuation for the
larger pearls, which are the rarest, will readily be apparent, but that
the correct value of a pearl of one, ten, twenty or fifty grains be definitely
given for the years 1602, 1702, 1802, or 1902 is an impossibility.
However, we believe this to be the first attempt to present so large a
body of carefully selected quotations, and they are given to the reader,
whether he be layman or professional, for what they are worth.</p>

<p class='c013'>In regard to the smaller pearls, as is the case with the smaller diamonds,
prices have been dependent upon the changes of fashion; that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>is, whether the prevailing style of jewelry was such that the smaller
pearl or diamond was in demand. In other words, if they were used
as a decoration forming a border, a flower, a scroll ornament, or a pave
requiring many small gems, the demand naturally increased and the
prices were higher or lower as the occasion required.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not the project of this book to fix the prices of pearls at the
present time, for any such attempt would prove misleading, owing to
the fact that pearls vary in the estimation of the different dealers, and
a figure given here for the highest standard, if applied to an inferior
grade, would necessarily mislead the buyer to his positive injury. This
much, however, can be said: during the year 1907 pearls from five
grains upward have been sold according to their quality, at a base of
five, eight, ten, fifteen, or even twenty dollars in very exceptional cases;
that is to say, twenty, thirty-two, forty, sixty, or eighty shillings, or
twenty-five, forty, fifty, seventy-five or one hundred francs. Nevertheless,
it would be impossible, without considerable experience, for a
layman to apply these valuations to objects that require much practice
in determining their quality and perfection.</p>

<p class='c013'>With diamonds, rubies, and emeralds there may be a stated price per
carat for stones of a certain size, but a gem of unusual perfection or
brilliancy, or of exceptionally fine color, will often command a price
far beyond that generally quoted. It is the same with the pearl. Sums
which may seem exorbitant in comparison with those that are paid for
ordinary pearls, are often given for specimens remarkable for their
beauty, size, or luster.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls of one hundred grains are even more rare at the present time
than are diamonds of one hundred carats. Until the middle of the
nineteenth century, the diamonds of the world weighing one hundred
carats or over could be counted on the fingers, but since the opening of
the African mines in 1870, the number of large diamonds has increased
at a much greater ratio than have the pearls of one quarter of
their weight. It would thus seem that pearls of great size are worth
four times as much as diamonds of equal weight. For instance, a
100–carat diamond of the finest quality would be worth at least
from $1000 to $1500 a carat, making a total value of $100,000 to
$150,000; and a pearl of 100 grains at a base of $10 would be worth
$100,000. But no such high price has ever been paid.</p>

<p class='c013'>The usual method of estimating the value of pearls is by establishing
a base value for those weighing one grain and then multiplying
this amount by the square of the number of grains that the pearl
weighs. For instance, if the base value of a one-grain pearl should be
fixed at $1, a pearl weighing two grains would be worth $4 (2 × 2 =
4), or $2 per grain; one weighing five grains would be worth $25, or
$5 per grain, etc. Naturally, these values increase in proportion to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>increase in the value of the base. A base of $3 would give a value of
$75 for a five-grain pearl, or $15 per grain, while a $10 base would
make the value $50 per grain, or $250.</p>

<p class='c013'>This method of estimating pearls by squaring their weights has
been credited by many authors to David Jeffries, who published an
interesting treatise on diamonds and pearls in 1750–1753. It has also
been credited to Tavernier, the oriental traveler of the middle of the
seventeenth century. We have, however, traced this method back to
Anselmus de Boot, in his treatise on precious stones, dated 1609. Before
this date we have not been able to find any mention of the computation
of the value of diamonds and pearls by squaring their weight
and multiplying the product by a base of a franc, guilder, crown, dollar,
or of many dollars, as would be necessary at present. It is probable,
however, that this system is of oriental origin and it may have
come to Europe through some of the oriental traders, with the precious
stones, as did the use of the carat.</p>

<p class='c013'>De Boot makes the carat (four grains) his unit of comparison,
increasing his base value by one third for pearls weighing eleven
carats (forty-four grains) or over. In Pio Naldi’s treatise, published
in Bologna in 1791, the unit is the grain, the base being the fourth part
of the value of four pearls weighing together one carat. Naldi, also,
increases his base value making it 1½ lire ($.30) for pearls weighing
less than ten grains, and 2½ lire ($.50) for those weighing twenty
grains and upward.</p>

<p class='c013'>A curious method of valuing pearls by their weight is shown in a
treatise by Buteo, published in 1554.<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c017'><sup>[382]</sup></a> The writer states that a pearl
weighing two carats was valued at 5 gold crowns; one of four carats
at 25 crowns; and so on, the price increasing fivefold when the weight
was doubled. The intermediate figures were obtained by computing
the proportional mean of any two known weights and values. For example:
8 × 4 = 32, the square root of which is 5.656. Now, the value
of a four-carat pearl is 25 and that of an eight-carat pearl 125 crowns,
and 125 × 25 = 3125, the square root being 55.9; hence a pearl weighing
5.656 carats was worth 55.9 crowns.</p>

<p class='c013'>The base value of a necklace can be determined in the following
way. Should the center pearl weigh 25 grains, multiply 25 by 25; the
result is 625; then, take the next two, three, or four pearls, as many
as are of approximately the same weight, add their weights together,
multiply the resulting figure by itself and divide the product by the
number of pearls in the group. Proceed in exactly the same way with
the remainder of the necklace, always grouping the pearls so that there
shall not be a considerable difference in weight between the smallest
and the largest pearl, and then add together the figures obtained for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>the center pearl and for the various groups and divide the price of the
necklace by this total; the quotient will represent the multiple or base.</p>

<p class='c013'>As may be seen by comparison of the first with the second and third
of the accompanying tables, the result arrived at in this way will, if
there is any difference in the weight of the pearls in the various
groups, vary slightly from that obtained by calculating the weight of
each pearl separately, but it represents a satisfactory approximation.</p>

<p class='c013'>On a $5 base this would represent a value of $49,946.30 and one of
$24,973.15 on a base of $2.50. The different grouping of the pearls
accounts for the slight reduction in value.</p>

<p class='c013'>A system of estimating the value of pearls which has recently been
introduced into Germany, is an adaptation of the ordinary method of
squaring the number of grains and then multiplying the result by a
certain base figure. The pearls are first grouped according to quality
and size, and a figure is agreed upon as the multiplicator of each class.
In Germany the carat is employed as the weight unit for pearls as well
as for diamonds, and in this new system the total weight of a given
number of pearls of the same class is first reduced to grains; the number
of grains is then multiplied by four and the quotient is multiplied
by the figure agreed upon. The resulting sum, after being divided by
the number of pearls, gives the carat value of such pearls. For example,
if the base figure agreed upon is 5, and we wish to find the carat
worth of 4 pearls of similar size, weighing together 3<sup>1</sup>4⁄<sub>64</sub> carats, the
sum would be as follows:</p>

    <td class='c039'>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c013'>At this rate per carat, reckoning in marks, the value of the 3<sup>1</sup>4⁄<sub>64</sub>
carats would be 207.20 marks. This result is identical with that obtained
by the ordinary method, but the calculation is perhaps a trifle
simplified.<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c017'><sup>[383]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>A curious Hindu treatise on gems has been preserved for us in the
Brhatsamhitâ of Varâhamihira (505–587 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>). It is the earliest work
of this kind that we have in Sanskrit, and M. Louis Finot,<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c017'><sup>[384]</sup></a> who has
published it, together with several other similar treatises, believes that
it was based upon an original composed at a much earlier period. In
his introduction M. Finot says: “It would be an error to regard the
ratnaçastra [treatise on gems] as a simple manual for the use of jewelers.
Without doubt this subject formed one of the principal branches
of commercial instruction,&nbsp;... but it was also taught to princes and
it is for their use that the ratnaçastras we publish seem to have been

<p class='c013'>This treatise only describes four gems, although a larger number
are enumerated. These gems are the diamond, the pearl, the ruby, and
the emerald. One of the most interesting portions is that treating of
the valuation of pearls. The system described is peculiar, and, unfortunately,
there is some difficulty in finding an absolutely correct equivalent
for the values expressed.</p>

grains). This is estimated at 5300 kârsâpanas (about $1600). As
the weight diminishes the valuation decreases as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>It would be extremely interesting if we could find at this early date
(sixth century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) an indication of the use of the system of computing
the value of pearls by the square of their weight as expressed
in some weight unit, and it is singular that the three valuations given
for the weight in guñjas are graduated in accordance with this system.
A pearl weighing 2½ guñjas and valued at 35 kârṣapâṇas would
have a base value of 5.6 kârṣâpaṇas. Estimated at this ratio we would
have the following figures:</p>

<table class='table5' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c021'>3 guñjas</td>
    <td class='c022'>50.4 kârṣâpaṇas</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c021'>4 guñjas</td>
    <td class='c022'>89.6 kârṣâpaṇas</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c013'>Now, the values actually given are 50 and 90 kârṣâpaṇas, respectively,
and these figures are easily obtained by rejecting the fraction
that is less than one half and counting the fraction that is in excess of
one half as a unit. After this, however, the progression becomes irregular.
A pearl weighing 1 mâṣaka (5 guñjas) is valued at 135 kârṣâpaṇas,
while the equivalent according to the system would be 140.
However, it is possible that the writer may have changed this figure
intentionally so as to add exactly one half to the preceding valuation
(90 + 45 = 135). The succeeding values bear no relation to the system
and appear to be entirely arbitrary. Still, it can scarcely be due to
hazard that the first three figures are practically in exact accord with
the system and the fourth in close approximation. As the change
seems to come when the weight is expressed in mâṣakas instead of
guñjas, we are tempted to think that the system may have been used
for single pearls weighing less than twelve grains (1 mâṣaka = 11¼
grains), while the value of those over that weight was estimated in a
different way.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a much later Hindu treatise, by Buddhabhatta, after certain
values have been given for pearls of the best quality, a pearl of this
class is described as follows:</p>

<p class='c020'>White, round, heavy, smooth, luminous, spotless, the pearl gifted
with these qualities is called qualified (<i>guṇavat</i>). If it be yellow, it is
worth half this price; if it be not round, a third; if flat or triangular, a
sixth.<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c017'><sup>[386]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>One of the earliest records we have of a system of prices for pearls is
the treatise on precious stones written in the year 1265, by Ahmed ibn
Yusuf al Teifashi, who was probably a native jeweler of Egypt. In
his time pearls were sold in Bagdad in bunches of ten strings, each
string comprising thirty-six pearls. If one of these strings weighed
one sixth of a miskal (four carats or sixteen grains), the ten strings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>were valued at four dinars (about ten dollars). The values increased
progressively as follows:<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c017'><sup>[387]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Al Teifashi then proceeds to describe a pearl of the first quality; it
must be “perfectly round in all its parts, colorless and gifted with a
fine water. When a pearl possesses these requisites and weighs one
miskal [24 carats or 96 grains] it is worth 300 dinars [$750]. If,
however, a match is found for this pearl and each one weighs one
miskal and has the same form, the two pearls together cost 700 dinars
[$1750].” This writer also mentions that in the shops of the Arab
jewelers, the pearl which exceeded the weight of a drachma (12 carats
or 48 grains) even by one grain, was called <i>dorra</i>, while the name
<i>johar</i> was used for that which did not reach the above weight.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1838, Feuchtwanger gave the price of a one-carat pearl as five
dollars, and used this amount as the multiplier of the square of the
weight; therefore, a four-carat pearl would cost four times four multiplied
by five dollars, the value of the first carat; that is to say, a sixteen-grain
(four-carat) pearl would have been worth eighty dollars in
1838, according to this computation.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>Giving the pearl values in 1867, Emanuel<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c017'><sup>[396]</sup></a> says: “It would be almost
useless to give any value for drop pearls, as when of large size and fine
quality they are of so rare occurrence as to command fancy prices;
still, as a slight guide, it may be mentioned that perfect white
drop pearls, of 80 to 100 grains, may be estimated at from £7 to £11
[$35–$55] per grain; those of 50 to 80 grains at from £4 to £7
[$20–$35] per grain, and those of 30 to 50 grains at from £3–£5
[$15–$25] per grain; smaller sizes bring from 20s. to 60s. [$5–$15]
per grain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Emanuel also states that misshapen pieces called “baroque pearls”
(<i>perles baroques</i>), are sold by the ounce, the price varying from £10
to £200 ($50–$1000) per ounce, depending on quality, color, and size.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pio Naldi’s treatise of 1791 gives the following rule for estimating
the value of small, round pearls, weighing less than one carat or four
grains. As the carat value of four such pearls is given as five lire and
576 one-grain pearls were counted as one ounce, these two numbers
were used to determine the value of an ounce of small pearls. The
product of 576 multiplied by 5 is 2880, and this number was then
divided by 2000, 1000, 500, or whatever might be the number of pearls
in a given ounce. If there were 2000 pearls, the carat value would
be 1.44 lire or $.29; if there were 1000, the carat would be worth 2.88
lire or $.57; if 500, 5.76 lire or $1.15, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>The same author<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c017'><sup>[398]</sup></a> gives tables expressing the values of pearls not
perfectly spherical in form, which he designates as “perle dolce.”
These pearls he considers to be worth half the price of good round
pearls; that is to say, 2½ lire (about $.50) per carat for four weighing
together one carat. Where there are as many as three thousand of
these “perle dolce” in an ounce, the 2½ lire base is multiplied by 576,
the number of grains given to the ounce; this makes the value of an
ounce of one-grain pearls $288. This amount is then divided by 3000,
and the quotient, $.096, represents the value of one carat of these small
pearls. Multiplying this by 144 we obtain, as the value of an ounce of
such pearls, $13.82. An ounce consisting of two thousand would be
worth $20.73, while if there were but one hundred to the ounce it would
be valued at $414.72, or $4.15 for each pearl and $.72 per grain of
weight. In this latter case the pearls would average 5¾ grains. Another
class of pearls denominated by this author as “scaramazzi,”
pearls of an irregular form and with protuberances, are estimated in
a similar way, but at exactly half of the above values. The baroque
pearls were not considered to be worth even half as much as the
“scaramazzi.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Scotch pearls (fresh-water) are mentioned by De Boot (1609, p.
88 <i>sq.</i>) among the other western pearls—Bohemian, etc. He remarks
that they were valued much less than the oriental pearls, but
if they were of especially pure color their value was greater, although
they lacked the silvery hue characteristic of the eastern pearl.
Fine pearls of this sort were valued on a carat base of one fourth of a
thaler ($.27), so that a forty-grain pearl was worth $27, and one of
eighty grains, $108. The author of the Bologna treatise, “Delle
Gemme,” 1791, attributes the lack of luster in the Scotch pearls to
the presence of a dark mass in the interior which interfered with the
passage of light. He estimates Scotch pearls to be worth one half
the value of oriental pearls of mediocre quality, provided the former
are fairly good.</p>

<p class='c013'>A Scotch writer of the seventeenth century is more enthusiastic in
regard to these pearls; he mentions having paid one hundred rix dollars
for an exceptionally fine one, but he does not specify its weight.
This is the value given by De Boot for a pearl of this class weighing
eighty grains, as we have just mentioned. The Scotch writer asserts
that he could never sell a necklace of fine Scotch pearls in Scotland itself,
as every one wanted oriental pearls; he continues: “At this very
day I can show some of our own Scots Pearls as fine, more hard and
transparent than any Oriental. It is true that the Oriental can be
easier matched, because they are all of a yellow water, yet foreigners
covet Scots Pearls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In Ceylon<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c017'><sup>[399]</sup></a> and India, pearl-grading and valuing has received close
attention, and an elaborate system has been evolved by the pearl
merchants. This system has been in use for generations and possibly
for centuries. Although apparently very complicated, it is in reality
quite simple, if we only remember that the value of inferior pearls is
determined by their weight, whereas the value of superior pearls is
computed from the square of their weight.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>The pearls are first grouped according to the size, of which ten
grades are made. This is done by passing them successively through
ten brass saucer-like sieves or baskets (<i>peddi</i>), each about three and
a half inches in diameter and one inch deep. The holes in the bottom
of each sieve are of uniform size, but they are graduated in size for
the different baskets. The pearls are sifted in the basket with the
largest holes, and those which will not pass through are of the first
size. The pearls which pass through are then sifted in the second
basket, and those retained are of the second size; and so on through
the entire series of ten sieves or baskets. Those which pass through
the tenth sieve are known as <i>masi-túl</i>, or powder pearls; they are of
little value owing to their very small size, and are not subject to further
classification. Of course, the attached pearls or very irregular
baroques—the <i>oddumuttu</i>—are not subject to the sifting process, and
are valued independently of this.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sometimes in India, as well as in western countries, false measures
are used, and an oriental pearl merchant may have one set of sieves
for use in buying and another for selling. The rule for determining
the proper size of the holes in the first sieve is that they may pass
pearls weighing 20 to the <i>kalan̄chǔ</i>, whence this sieve is commonly
known as the “20 <i>peddi</i>.” The second sieve is the “30 <i>peddi</i>,” since it
passes pearls weighing 30 to the <i>kalan̄chǔ</i>. In the proper order the
other sieves respectively pass pearls requiring 50, 80, 100, 200, 400,
600, 800, and 1000 to the <i>kalan̄chǔ</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>This use of sieves for grading the Ceylon pearls was mentioned by
Cleandro Arnobio, a writer of the latter part of the sixteenth century,
in his “Tesoro delle Gioie,” and he took his description from an older
writer, Garzia dell’ Horto.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the sifting, each of the ten graded lots of pearls are placed
on pieces of cloth for classification as to quality, shape, and luster.
This classification requires much skill and judgment on the part of
the valuer. Not only will two persons commonly fail to class a large
lot of pearls exactly alike, but one person is not likely to class the same
lot twice in precisely the same manner.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>From long established custom, recognition is made of twelve classes
into which the ten grades or sizes of pearls are divided with respect to
shape and luster, the local names of these classes giving a fair indication
of their respective characteristics. These names are:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1</dt>
    <dd><i>Ani</i>, “best”: perfect in sphericity and luster, the true orient pearl.
    </dd>
    <dt>2</dt>
    <dd><i>Anatári</i>, “follower”: failing slightly in sphericity and luster.
    </dd>
    <dt>3</dt>
    <dd><i>Masanku</i> or <i>Masaku</i>: badly colored pearls, usually gray, symmetrical, and
    with luster.
    </dd>
    <dt>4</dt>
    <dd><i>Kaiyéral</i>, “the clasp of a necklace”: a dark-colored treble pearl, not quite round.
    </dd>
    <dt>5</dt>
    <dd><i>Machchakai.</i>
    </dd>
    <dt>6</dt>
    <dd><i>Vadivu</i>, “beauty,” also “decreasing”: that which is strained or sifted; found in
    the 100, 200, and 400 sieves. These small pearls, regular in shape, and of good luster,
    are especially favored in the East.
    </dd>
    <dt>7</dt>
    <dd><i>Madanku</i>, “folded,” or “bent”: all pearls of <i>vadivu</i> size that are imperfect
    in form or color.
    </dd>
    <dt>8</dt>
    <dd><i>Kǔrǔval</i>, “short”: deformed and double pearls; they may, however, be of excellent
    luster. <i>Ani Kǔrǔval</i>: where two <i>áni</i> are fused together, but so formed that
    if separate they would be perfectly spherical. <i>Písal Kǔrǔval</i>: where several pearls
    of good luster and color are fused partially and irregularly together. <i>Pampara
    Kǔrǔval</i>: a pearl grooved regularly, like a top.
    </dd>
    <dt>9</dt>
    <dd><i>Kalippu</i>, “abundance,” or “rejected”: inferior to <i>Anatári</i>; a good pearl, may
    be lens-shaped or elongated; usually flattened.
    </dd>
    <dt>10</dt>
    <dd><i>Písal</i>, “torn”: a deformed pearl or cluster of small misshapen pearls; of poor
    color and of little value.
    </dd>
    <dt>11</dt>
    <dd><i>Kurál</i>: very misshapen and small.
    </dd>
    <dt>12</dt>
    <dd><i>Túl</i>, “powder”: the seed-pearls, those retained by the 600, 800, and 1000 sieves.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c013'>In addition to the above designations, the following are also used:</p>

<p class='c045'><i>Samadiam</i>: a pearl of a reddish hue; pear-shaped but of dull color.</p>

<p class='c045'><i>Nimelai</i>: a nose-pearl, perfect skinned, and pear- or egg-shaped.</p>

<p class='c045'><i>Sirippu</i>: a pearl grooved with irregular wrinkle-like furrows.</p>

<p class='c045'><i>Kodai</i>, “brown”: like a nut, with no nacreous luster; formed of prismatic
shell; may be large, is usually spherical, and includes pearls
of various colors. This name is also used for white pearls with
black or brown marks. <i>Van Kodai</i>: a <i>kodai</i> pearl with one side
nacreous. <i>Karunk Kodai</i>: a black or blue-black slag-like pearl.</p>

<p class='c045'><i>Masi-túl</i>, “ink-dust,” or “chalk-powder”: smaller than the 1000 sieve.
Generally used for medicinal purposes, or burnt and eaten with
areca-nut and betel by the natives.</p>

<p class='c045'><i>Oddu</i>—or <i>Ottumuttu</i>, “shell-pearl”: an attached pearl or nacreous excrescence
on the outside of the shell.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the twelve classes named above, the first four are known as the
<i>chevvǔ</i>, or superior classes; the next three as the <i>vadivu</i>, or beautiful
classes; and the last five as the <i>kalan̄chǔ</i>, or inferior classes. The
<i>chevvǔ</i> pearls are found only in the first four sieves or baskets; and
for this reason these are known as the <i>chevvǔ peddi</i> or “chevvǔ baskets,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>although they may also retain inferior pearls. A name used to
indicate the class of pearls found in the first four sieves is <i>mel</i> or <i>melmuttu</i>,
“upper” or “superior pearl,” while <i>vadivu</i> designates those retained
by the next three and <i>túl</i> those of the last three.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the pearls have been graded according to size and classified according
to quality, they are weighed. The unit of weight is the <i>manchádi</i>,
the seed of <i>Abrus precatorius</i>, a small, red berry of practically uniform
weight when ripe. H. W. Gillman of the Ceylon Civil Service reports
the weight of the <i>man̄chádi</i> to be 3.35 grains troy. Fractional parts of
a unit are obtained by using a berry called <i>kundumani</i>, grains of rice,
etc., whose weights have been determined beforehand. A brass weight—the
<i>kalan̄chǔ</i>—is also employed; it equals 67 grains or 20 <i>man̄chádi</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>However, choice pearls—those of the superior classes—are not
valued in this manner, but at so much per <i>chevvǔ</i> of their weight,
which is three fourths of the square of the weight in <i>man̄chádi</i>. Thus,
to find the value of an <i>anatári</i> pearl in the second sieve, if the weight
be found to be three <i>man̄chádi</i>, three fourths of the square of three,
or 6¾, is multiplied by the base value of the <i>anatári</i> class.</p>

<p class='c013'>The actual process of the calculation of value is as follows: owing
to the small size of the pearls, many fractions enter into the computations;
to preserve uniformity it is customary to increase all fractions
so that each may have 320 as a denominator, this being a common multiple
of those that ordinarily arise in <i>chevvǔ</i> calculations. The weight
in <i>man̄chádi</i> of the pearls is increased to a fractional figure having
320 as a denominator. Three fourths of the square of the numerator
of this fraction is divided by the number of pearls, and this quotient
is divided twice consecutively by 320, giving the <i>chevvǔ</i> of the weight.
The market value then follows from the quoted price of the pearls per
<i>chevvǔ</i> at the time.</p>

<p class='c013'>In actual practice, these computations are not made; but each merchant
provides himself with sets of tables showing the calculations for
different weights, analogous to the use of interest tables by bankers,
or of tables of logarithms by surveyors. Some of the merchants
commit these tables to memory, and at times may be heard reciting
them quietly to themselves to refresh the memory.</p>

<p class='c013'>If a pearl of a particular grade and class is of exceptional merit,
the merchant adds somewhat to the money value computed by the
above process. This applies especially to double pearls of the <i>kǔrǔval</i>
class, which sometimes consist of two fine bouton pearls suitable for
setting, but not for stringing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls of one of the inferior or <i>kalan̄chǔ</i> classes are valued by
simple weight, at so much per <i>kalan̄chǔ</i>, the market price, of course,
differing for pearls of the various classes. The weight having been
ascertained, each in its class as before noted, the value is determined
by multiplying that weight by the current market price per unit of
such pearls, at so many rupees per <i>kalan̄chǔ</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>The star pagoda is used in calculating the values. This small gold
coin was current in south India in the early part of the last century.
In the computations it is considered to be worth three and a half
rupees, although its intrinsic value as a gold coin is about six rupees.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is considered probable that the London syndicate,<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c017'><sup>[400]</sup></a> which has
lately leased the Ceylon pearl fisheries for a period of twenty years,
will do away with the complicated calculations employed for so many
generations, surviving all changes of administration, Portuguese,
Dutch, and British. This is only one of the many instances showing the
tendency of the British Government to abolish time-honored usages
in India, without regard to the wishes of its population; and, unimportant
as many of these changes may seem to us, they all serve to
foster a spirit of discontent that may lead to serious trouble. This
conduct on the part of Great Britain is all the stranger in view of the
stubborn opposition of that country to the adoption of the scientific
and logical metric system.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Bombay, the weight of pearls in tanks is made the basis of their
valuation; the tank equals 24 ratti or about 72 grains troy. The
square of the number of tanks is multiplied by 330 and the quotient
divided by the number of pearls; this gives the number of <i>chevvǔs</i>, or
<i>chows</i>, as they are sometimes called, and the market price of the
<i>chevvǔs</i> for a given class of pearls shows their value. If, for instance,
we have 56 pearls of a certain quality, weighing 5 tanks, and the
<i>chevvǔs</i> of these pearls is worth 14 rupees, the sum would be as follows:</p>

<table class='table5' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c021'>5 × 5 × 330 × 14</td>
    <td class='c039'>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c021'><hr /></td>
    <td class='c039'>= 2062.5 rupees, or about $825.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c021'>56</td>
    <td class='c039'>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c018'>In this case, as in the other system of weighing which we have mentioned,
the <i>chevvǔs</i> is only a nominal weight; but there is in India a real
weight unit which bears this name.<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c017'><sup>[401]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The high esteem in which the pearl was held by the Hindus is well
illustrated by the following statement from an old treatise on gems:
“A pearl weighing two kalan̄jas (about 180 grains) should not be
worn even by kings. It is for the gods, it is without equal.”<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c017'><sup>[402]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>An interesting account of a great savant’s experience, in the early
part of the sixteenth century, regarding the value of pearls, is given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>by Guillaume Budé<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c017'><sup>[403]</sup></a> (1467–1540), the celebrated French Hellenist
who lived during the reign of Francis I and who is regarded as the
founder of the College de France. In his work entitled “De Asse,” he
states that he once inquired of a gem dealer in Paris whether the latter
could recall the weight of some remarkable pearl which had passed
through his hands. The dealer replied that he had seen one weighing
30 carats (120 grains), whereupon another gem dealer, who was
present, remarked that he had in his possession one of 40 carats (160
grains). This pearl was sold a few days later for 3000 gold crowns
($6750). On another occasion Budé was told that a pearl of exquisite
beauty weighing 30 carats, had been sold to the Duchesse de Bourbon,
daughter of Louis XI of France, for the sum of 4000 gold
crowns ($9000).</p>

<p class='c013'>In regard to the manner of computing the value of pearls Budé
writes: “I think the ratio of these prices can be calculated. When I
asked a gem dealer what was the value of a pearl of four carats [sixteen
grains], according to the formula, he replied: ‘I have seen such a
pearl sell for thirty gold crowns [$67.50].’ Whereupon I asked: ‘How
much would you estimate one weighing eight carats [thirty-two
grains]?’ ‘At least two hundred gold crowns [$450],’ he answered;
and as I continued to ply him with questions, gradually increasing the
weight, he responded in such a way that I could understand that the
increase of the price bore not a numerical, but a proportional relation
to the weight; so that the above mentioned eight-carat pearl, having
double the weight of a four-carat pearl, was valued at seven times as
much. The same was true of a pearl weighing twelve carats, twenty
carats, and so on; the price augmenting by a greater and greater increment
as the weight increased.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In the “Coronae Gemma Noblissima” of Wilhelmus Eo (1621, pp.
32, 33), an instance is given of the rapid changes that are possible
in the worth of a pearl. A large and beautiful pearl was brought
to Nuremberg by a merchant who had paid 500 florins for it; he soon
found a purchaser among the merchants there, who was willing to
pay him 800 florins. This latter merchant in his turn disposed of his
gem for 1000 florins, and shortly after it again changed hands twice,
the first time at an advance of 200 florins and the second at an advance
of 300 florins. All this happened within a few days. The writer tells
us that the last purchaser, who paid 1500 florins for the pearl, took
it with him to Venice “where the wealthy dames wear a great treasure
of beautiful pearls as necklaces upon their bare skin, and he will not
have lost anything on his pearl there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1884, Mr. Edwin Streeter was asked by a member of a London
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>syndicate to proceed to the East, to value a large quantity of jewels,
as a heavy sum of money was about to be advanced to a certain Power,
to provide the sinews of war. On his way he was requested to stop at
one of the principal towns in Germany to purchase some jewels which
had been valued for probate but were not easy of sale in that market.
The valuation paper was shown to him, and after examining the ornaments,
he agreed to take them at the prices named. Among them was
an old gold brooch of Russian manufacture, valued at £4; in the center
of this brooch was what appeared to be a piece of hematite, but was in
reality a fine, round, black pearl, weighing 77 grains. The color
had faded from exposure to the sun. This pearl was brought to
London, and the outer layer was taken off, when a perfect black
pearl of 67 grains was uncovered. This was sold to a manufacturing
jeweler in London for £400; but, having heard that in Paris there
was a pearl that would exactly match it, Mr. Streeter bought it back
again for £600, and then sold it at a large profit to one of the Paris
crown jewelers, who, in his turn, sold the pair to a rich iron merchant
for 50,000 francs (£2000 or $10,000). Since then the sum of 100,000
francs (£4000 or $20,000) has been refused for this pair of matchless
black pearls. At present values they may be worth double this sum.</p>

<p class='c013'>At different times the values assigned to the different forms and
colors of pearls have varied. For instance, in the French Encyclopédie
of 1774 (Vol. XII, p. 385), it is stated that pear-shaped pearls, although
they might be equally perfect and of the same weight as round
pearls, were valued much less than these. Even in the case of well-matched
pairs, their price was a third less than that of round pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>As early as the sixteenth century it was not uncommon that jewelers
who had in their possession a fine pear-shaped pearl would have a replica
of it molded in lead, and then send the casts to the large cities of
Europe and the East. If a mate was found for it, the respective owners
soon came to terms, for such pearls command a much higher price
together than they do separately.</p>

<p class='c013'>An interesting story is told of no less a collector than the Duke of
Brunswick, who was so generous to the city of Geneva. For many
years every pear-shaped pearl from every land had been submitted to
him for examination. He always claimed the privilege of examining
it alone for a moment or two and in every instance he returned it. At
last a new pear-shaped pearl of marvelous size and beauty was heard
of in a distant country. It was sent to Germany, where the duke was
visiting at that time, to a local dealer who acted as agent for the
owner. The price demanded for it seemed excessive, but the duke took
the pearl, stepped aside for a moment, and said, quick as a flash, “The
pearl is mine.” The next day he showed it with a mate he had owned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>for many years and that was a most faultless match. Through all the
years of his search he had never informed any one of his intention to
match the pearl he already owned.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1879, at the time of the death of the father of Sultan Buderuddin
of the Sulu Islands, a box of large and fine pearls was among the
treasures he left behind him. Many of these disappeared, but
some of them came into the hands of Sultan Buderuddin and his
mother. The former sold those which he had inherited, in order to
defray the expenses of a pilgrimage to Mecca, in 1882. His mother,
who exerted a great influence over the conduct of affairs, retained a
number of the pearls, and it was always difficult to induce her to part
with any of them. When, as very rarely happened, she was persuaded
to do so, she invariably got a higher price for them than they would
have commanded in London, because she was never anxious to sell,
and always said: “Why should I sell my pearls? If the Spaniards
come to attack us, I can put them in a handkerchief and go into
the hills; but if I had dollars I should need a number of men to carry
them.” We do not yet know what became of the stolen pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many times has a dealer put nearly all that he possessed into a fine
pearl or necklace, frequently without a reward; often gradually buying
more and more, hoping for some great patron to relieve him.
When the client appears, there is happiness, but when he does not,
there is woe. This instance is well illustrated when Philip IV of Spain
asked of the merchant Gogibus: “How have you ventured to put all
your fortune into such a small object?” “Because I knew there was a
king of Spain to buy it of me,” was the quick reply. And Philip rewarded
the faith of the jeweler by purchasing the pearl.</p>

<p class='c013'>Caire and Dufie<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c017'><sup>[404]</sup></a> state:</p>

<p class='c020'>We need have no fear that either the price or the use of pearls will diminish
when we consider the great demand for them both on account of luxury and
superstition. There is no Hindu who does not regard it as a matter of religion
that he should pierce at least one pearl on the occasion of his marriage. This
must be a new pearl which has never been perforated. Whatever may be the
mysterious signification, this very ancient usage is, at least, very useful for
the commerce of pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1898, one of the writers had a long talk with his late chief, who
had, at that time, devoted sixty years of his life to the jewelry profession.
In the course of the conversation the latter remarked: “It seems
to me that pearls are too dear”; to which the writer rejoined: “Have
pearls ever gone down in price during your entire connection with the
jewelry profession?” The answer was: “No, they have always advanced.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>Whereupon the writer said: “I can give you statistics for
two hundred years preceding your earliest experience, which prove
that pearls constantly advanced in value during that period.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The following are the names given to the different kinds of pearls,
according to their origin.</p>

<p class='c013'>The term “oriental” designates those pearls that are found in the
true pearl-oyster, and have a marine or salt-water origin, being found
either in the ocean or one of its adjacent tributaries, and belonging to
one of the numerous species of the Margaritiferæ.</p>

<p class='c013'>The term “fresh-water” is given to those pearls that are found in
the fresh-water brooks, rivulets, rivers, or fresh-water lakes, and not
in salt water, and which belong to the Unionidæ.</p>

<p class='c013'>The term “conch” is applied to that variety of pearl which is usually
pink, or yellow, in color, and that is either found in the univalve shell,
known as the common conch (<i>Strombus gigas</i>), or in the yellow shell
(<i>Cassis madagascarensis</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>The word “clam pearl” is used to designate those pearls that are
found in the common clam of the Atlantic coast, and are either black,
dark purple, purple, or mixed with white, more especially if they are
boiled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Placuna pearl” designates those pearls that are found in the Placuna,
or window-glass shell, in the East. They have a micaceous luster,
are rarely of much value, and are sold entirely in the Orient,
almost exclusively for medicinal purposes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oyster pearl” signifies those concretions that are found in the common
edible oyster (Ostrea). They are generally black, purple, or with
a mixture of black and white, or purple and white. They are devoid of
nacreous luster and possess neither beauty nor value.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Coque de perle” designates the globuse walls of the nautilus and
possibly other shells that have a pearly nacre; they are almost hemispherical
and are either round or long, having a pearly effect.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Abalone”: a name applied to those pearls that are found in the univalve
“ear-shell” or <i>awabi</i>, as it is called in Japan. They are generally
green, blue-green, or fawn-yellow, and have an intense red,
flame-like iridescence. They are rarely round, generally flat, or irregular,
and are occasionally worth several hundreds of dollars each.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pinna pearls”: those pearls that are found in the Pinna, or wing-shells
of the Mediterranean and adjacent seas. These possess no orient,
but are more highly crystalline than any other pearls. They are
almost translucent and have a peculiar red or yellow color, and are
of little value except locally.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Cocoanut pearl”: this name is given to those pearls that are found
in the giant oyster or clam of the vicinity of Singapore; they are erroneously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>called cocoanut pearls because they have the appearance of the
meat of the cocoanut. They are often of great size, but have no commercial
value.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following are special designations of the different varieties of
pearls according to their forms and appearance:</p>

<p class='c013'>Paragon: this term was formerly used to designate large and exceptionally
perfect or beautiful pearls, usually weighing over one hundred
grains.</p>

<p class='c013'>Round: when the pearl is absolutely spherical, as if turned on a
lathe, without any flattening or any indentations on the sides.</p>

<p class='c013'>Button or Bouton: if the pearl is domed on top and has either a flat
or slightly convex back.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pear-shaped: when the pearl is formed like a pear, terminating in a
point, and is either flat at the lower end or rounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Drop-shaped: when the pearl is elongated like a pear, but is larger
at the lower end than a pear-shaped pearl.</p>

<p class='c013'>Egg-shaped: when ovate in form, rounded more or less at each end,
or formed like an egg.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cone-shaped: applied to pearls that are elongated and rounded with
one flat end, and have the form of a cone.</p>

<p class='c013'>Top-shaped: a name given to those pearls that are broad, flattened
at the top and rounded on the sides, terminating in a point, like a
top.</p>

<p class='c013'>Seed-pearls is a name given to pearls that are round or irregular,
and weigh one fourth grain or even less. They are frequently so small
that 18,000 are contained in a single ounce, and they are often sent
from the East in bunches of about a dozen or so of strings.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dust-pearls. When seed-pearls are very small they are known as
“dust-pearls”; they are really as fine as dust and have very little value;
still, their form is in many cases wonderfully perfect.</p>

<p class='c013'>Petal pearls are those which are somewhat flat, frequently more
pointed at one end than at the other, and have the appearance of a
petal or leaf.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hinge pearls are those pearls that are long, generally pointed at either
or both ends, and are found near the hinge part of the shell. They are
divided into two distinct forms, namely dog-tooth, and wing-shaped.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wing pearls: those that are elongated or irregular, resembling a
wing or part of a wing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dog-tooth: applied to pearls with pointed ears, elongated, and
which are narrower than the wing pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Slugs: a name used for the very irregular, distorted pearls, frequently
made up of masses or groups of small pearls; usually without
luster or form, and of little value except for medicinal purposes.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>Nuggets: when the pearls are somewhat round, but are indented or
slightly irregular.</p>

<p class='c013'>Haystacks: when the pearls are either round or oval, with the top
considerably elevated.</p>

<p class='c013'>Turtlebacks: when the pearls are a trifle longer than they are wide,
with a domed surface not much elevated. This form is quite prevalent
among American pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Strawberry pearls: those that are round or elongated and entirely
covered with prickly points, somewhat resembling a strawberry or
pickle. It is believed that these irregular marks are frequently produced
by minute pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blister” and “Chicot” are names applied to those pearls that are
found embedded within a nacreous coating, often containing mud,
water, or imperfect mother-of-pearl. After these “blisters,” as they
are termed, are broken, and layer after layer has been removed from
the contents, very fine pearls have frequently been found.</p>

<p class='c013'>Peelers: a term applied to pearls having imperfect surfaces or skins
that may have some inner layers which are perfect. Pearls having
opaque bands or rings are rarely peeled with much success as this
opaque layer frequently extends to some depth.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cylindrical pearls: for pearls that have the form of a cylinder, being
elongated and flattened at each end.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hammer pearls: when pearls are long and somewhat rounded and
assume the shape of a hammer or barrel. These are rounded or domed
at the side and flattened at the ends.</p>

<p class='c013'>Baroque (Wart pearls in German): when pearls are not of any perfect
form such as round, pear, ovate, or any regular form, they are
termed baroque, and this term covers a large class of varieties, such as
all that follow (except seed- and half-pearls).</p>

<p class='c013'>Double, triple, or twin pearls are those that are made up of two or
more pearls united together in a single nacreous coating, showing,
however, that they are still separate pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Monster pearls: this name was formerly applied to very large,
irregular, pearly masses which either resembled some animal or were
adapted to form the head, trunk, or other part of an animal: these are
also occasionally called “Paragons.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Bird’s-eye: a name used for a pearl that has dull spots, giving it the
appearance of a bird’s-eye.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ring-a-round” is a term applied to such pearls as are black, brown,
pink, or white, and have a circle running around the pearl itself of
some distinctive contrasting color, as white on black, pink on brown or
black on white.</p>

<p class='c013'>Embedded pearls are those that are partly or entirely surrounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>by mother-of-pearl, having been enveloped and passed outward from
the interior of the shell by the mollusk so that in time the pearl would
have been lost on the outside of the shell. These embedded pearls are
occasionally found in the manufacture of mother-of-pearl articles.
When the mother-of-pearl is split, the pearl will fall out from between
the layers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Half-pearls is the name given to such pearls as are round and spherically
domed, and are either somewhat flat or almost the shape of one
half of a whole pearl of the same diameter. They are usually made
by cutting off the best part of a hemispherical bright spot from a large
irregular pearl; frequently two to four cuttings are made from the
bright spots of a single pearl, each of the cuttings having the appearance
of half a pearl.</p>

<p class='c013'>The so-called Indian pearls have a faint rosy tint with much orient.
These are generally pearls from the Ceylonese fisheries that are sold
from the Bombay side. The term “Madras white” describes the
whiter varieties, there being a preference for these in Madras, while
the rosy, yellow, and darker shades are favored in Bombay.</p>

<p class='c013'>Australian pearls are generally a pure waxy white and lustrous,
often with a silver-white sheen, extremely brilliant and beautiful.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nearly all the Venezuela and Panama pearls have a faint golden-yellow
tint, very often extremely lustrous, and are especially desired
by the darker skinned people and brunettes.</p>

<p class='c013'>The preference at various times has varied with different peoples:
in China and India, golden-yellow and satin-yellow pearls are preferred;
from Panama we have the very white; in Bombay the yellow
pearls from the Persian Gulf are highly appreciated.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yellow pearls from other shells than the pearl-oyster are frequently
offered for sale in the East, where they are greatly appreciated, although
they find little favor in England. Some of these pearls are attributed
to the pearly nautilus (<i>Nautilus pompilius</i>). This may be the
case with those that have a pearly luster, but those that have the appearance
of porcelain, and are as bright as polished china, are certainly
not from this shell, but evidently from the large Melo or other
shells of that character. Some may come from the large conch (<i>Cassis
madagascarensis</i>). A yellow pearl, very perfect in form and color,
and weighing more than one hundred grains, was shown at the Paris
Exposition of 1889 and was valued at 50,000 francs.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wonderful golden-yellow pearls with a saffron tint are unusually lustrous
and beautiful. One of the most remarkable pearls of this character
is of a brilliant golden-yellow color which belongs to an American lady,
and weighs 30½ grains. These pearls are from Shark’s Bay, West
Australia, and only a limited number of them are found annually.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>Black pearls do not seem to have been regarded with any favor by
the ancients, and we find no mention of them by medieval writers.
Only fifty years ago a perfectly round, black pearl, weighing 8
grains, was sold for £4 ($20); to-day this pearl would easily bring
£100 ($500). Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, may be
said to have brought them into favor; she owned a splendid necklace
of black pearls which was sold at Christie’s, after the fall of Napoleon,
for the sum of £4000 ($20,000). Some time later, the Marquis of
Bath bought, at Christie’s, the pearl which formed the clasp of the
necklace, paying £1000 ($5000) for it; he destined it for the center of
a bracelet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Greenish-black pearls are perhaps valued higher than any other colored
pearls, if they have the proper orient; this is probably partly owing
to their rarity. A bluish-black pearl possessing a fine orient commands
almost the same price as a pure black pearl. Those which are
found in the <i>Placuna placenta</i> are often of a dull gray hue, while those
produced by the <i>Pinna squamosa</i> are generally brown in color.</p>

<p class='c013'>Baroque pearls were formerly much worn and appreciated in Spain
and Poland. Their price varies greatly, according to their size, their
beauty, and also to their scarcity in any particular place. The pieces
of pearl detached from the shells—often half-pearl and half mother-of-pearl,
and called “de fantaisie”—are always very irregular in
form, and sometimes offer a certain resemblance to a part of the human
or animal form.<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c017'><sup>[405]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>How is it that such quantities of jewels are continually brought
from the East, and such a wealth of them continues to exist there,
when there are now no very extensive mines that maintain a constant
supply? The reason is that from time immemorial, precious stones
have been the form in which wealth, in those lands, has been hoarded
and preserved. Until very recently, in the Orient, interest-bearing
securities have been unknown; and hence jewels have been sought
and kept as an investment, and sold only when money was needed for
special purposes, as in times of war, famine, or other emergency.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their small bulk made them easy to conceal and to transport, and
hence they were well adapted for such use. How long this condition
will last, is perhaps dependent only upon the introduction of interest-paying
investments, and of the new forms of Western civilization that
involve greater expenses and require means of income in excess of the
older and simpler conditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>The wealth of jewels possessed by Oriental monarchs, notables, and
dealers, has been the theme of story and tradition, time out of mind.
We of the West have been disposed to regard these tales as largely exaggerated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>and to some extent they may be; yet any one who has witnessed
an important social function or state occasion where East Indian
rajahs and nabobs are present, knows that the profusion of
jewels which they wear is simply astounding to our Western eyes.
These objects represent, moreover, the gatherings of generations and
centuries; they are heirlooms and ancestral treasures, priceless to
their owners as the pride of their houses; handed down from fathers
to sons in long succession; and they have also the investment feature
already noted, in that whenever necessity arises they can be turned
into available funds.</p>

<p class='c013'>The manner of keeping and of selling such objects is also different
from ours. If it be a question of buying gems from an Eastern owner,
the best are never shown first, but on the contrary, the most inferior.
The purchaser must either be content with these, or else must prove
clearly that he is a substantial buyer or evince a knowledge and appreciation
that mark him as a judge of such objects. The order in which
they are produced is, first the poorest, then successively, poor, medium,
fair, good, fine, and at last the rare and wonderful prizes.</p>

<p class='c013'>In visiting an Oriental dignitary, his jewel-treasures are not all
shown at once, as at an American reception or an Indian durbar, or
even as a collector or connoisseur among us exhibits his cabinet, arranged
for choice display. The method is far different. The visitor
may be shown a few objects in the first day or hour; perhaps a few
more later in the day; some on the next day or the one following,
and so on; and he may remain a guest for weeks, and never see all, or
the finest of the jewels belonging to his host. When they are produced,
moreover, they are not in iron caskets or in gold or silver jewel-cases,
covered or lined with fine leather or with silk or satin. On the
contrary, they are often in old ginger jars, shabby boxes, tin cans, and
all sorts of unsightly or unpromising receptacles, which, when placed
between the owner and his guest, may well cause the latter to wonder.
Nor is his surprise lessened as the wrappings are unfolded, one after
another, perhaps a dozen old cloths, until the piece of jewelry or the
splendid pearl is at last brought to view, after having been hidden from
sight in its manifold wrappings for months or perhaps for years.</p>

<p class='c013'>But this method of keeping such treasures is not in reality so
strange as it appears. There are none of the provisions that we have
for the responsible safe-guarding of investments or valuable objects,—no
fire-proof safes, no banks, no deposit-vaults. Security is best attained
by concealment in unattractive and improbable receptacles, and
by dividing and distributing the treasured objects. The owner, too,
must learn to know his visitor quite well before he exhibits to him all,
or the best, that he possesses. Hence the oriental method, though so
peculiar to us, has been the best adapted to the conditions among those
peoples.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>As an illustration of the interest taken by Oriental potentates in the
collection of jewels, we quote an instance from Marco Polo, who, centuries
ago, wrote the following:<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c017'><sup>[406]</sup></a> “Several times every year the King of
Maabar sends his proclamation through the realm that if any one who
possesses a pearl or stone of great value will bring it to him, he will pay
for it twice as much as it cost. Everybody is glad to do this, and thus
the King gets all into his own hands, giving every man his price.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Great quantities of pearls, the result of centuries of accumulation,
and exceeding in splendor the collections of the present day, must have
been garnered up in many cities of the Orient during the period of
their prosperity. But these cities have disappeared, wrecked and
ruined by fire and sword, and no vestige of their former wealth remains
with them. Their treasures have been looted, hoarded, buried,
or scattered to the four ends of the Orient, frequently finding their
way in former times to Europe, but now more often to America, where
fine gems always find a generous buyer.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Syria, and some of the Oriental countries, until recently, and perhaps
at the present time, it has been the custom, when a native wished
to embark in the pearl business, for him to allow himself to drift gradually
into a state of vagrancy, becoming a veritable tramp for fully a
year. Then, with the money that he had himself or that which was
supplied by his backer, he would visit the pearl fisheries and shrewdly
acquire the gems to the best advantage, returning again as a vagrant;
for if it were known at any point along the route that he carried with
him sums of money his life would be in jeopardy, and he would probably
never reach the fisheries; or, if he did, the chances are that he
would never return. This may remind us of Marco Polo’s old coat, in
which he had concealed some valuable gems, the gift of the Grand
Khan. His wife heedlessly gave the coat to a beggar and it was only
regained by a clever stratagem.</p>

<p class='c013'>The product of the pearl fisheries, either that of entire fisheries
where they are managed by a company, or the gatherings of merchants,
or even the single gems which may be acquired by the smaller
merchants, all these usually find their way to the great markets, although
occasionally they change hands at once. In the East they are
sent either to Bombay, Calcutta, Madras or Colombo; frequently they
are intended for a higher market. Many of them remain in the East,
for in the East to-day a fine pearl is as much prized as ever, and
there are those who love pearls as much as did the King of Maabar in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>the time of Marco Polo. However, the world over, there is a feeling
that if things are sent to the greatest market there will be an opportunity
for disposing of them at the greatest price. Therefore, the
larger number of parcels of exceptionally fine pearls are sent to the
London market, a few of them going to Paris, the cable, often within
a few days after their arrival, informing the sender of the acceptance
or rejection of a parcel, or of a new offer which is often accepted.
In this market they are acquired by the dealers, who frequently exhibit
many times before the lot is purchased.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls from a fishery are in many cases of mixed quality; that is to
say, they are of different sizes and varying grades of perfection as
regards skin, color, and orient. These parcels are often sold directly
on offers to dealers, but generally they are sold by brokers who show
the various parcels to the dealers, each of the latter in turn making his
offer on that portion of the parcel which is of most value to him. Thus
a single dealer may want one pearl, a dozen, or even twenty or more,
to complete a great necklace, or else to add to, or improve the necklace,
by better graduation or by increasing the evenness of the color. When
the broker receives enough offers to give him the desired price for the
entire parcel, the sale is consummated, and each one who has made an
offer and who has sealed his particular parcel until his offer is accepted
or rejected, receives his portion. Pearls do not grow in the form of
necklaces, although they are frequently seen in this form only, and to
create a large necklace means not only the use of the pearls of one
fishery alone, but it often requires a selection from pearls of various
sizes, the product of many fisheries.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is needless to say that even the shrewdest dealers do not always
succeed in their purchases of lots which are to be broken up when the
proper number of bids are obtained.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the pearl revival came in 1898 there was a sudden and rapid
upward tendency in the prices, because at that time, in England, money
could be borrowed upon a very low rate of interest—as low as 3 per
cent.,—and it was a temptation to a number of young men to enter as
dealers into the pearl trade. The result was that a number of new
stocks were created, not for a regular, but for a speculative demand,
and this tended to advance the price spasmodically, rather than gradually,
as it would have risen by regular consumption. However, when
the foreign market became higher, the demand for pearls was not as
great as had been anticipated, and there was a sudden adjustment of
prices and a readjustment of the pearl stocks, resulting in the elimination
of a certain number of speculative dealers; and, notwithstanding
the state of the fisheries, pearls have not advanced so rapidly in the
past two years as they did from 1898 to 1905.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>More than go per cent. of the pearls of commerce, whether they
are round, perfect, half- or seed-pearls, are of oriental origin; that is,
pearls from the true pearl-oyster. About 8 per cent. are probably
from the fresh-water mussels, three fourths of which are from the
United States.</p>

<p class='c013'>American fresh-water pearls have had many prejudices to overcome,
often because of the natural indifference in regard to anything
that is found at home or is easily obtainable. It has been said that, in
comparison with foreign pearls, they had less specific gravity; that
they were not so hard, and that their luster was not as good. It is
certain, however, that the skin is generally smooth, and although
they may not have so peculiar an orient, their brilliancy equals that
of any known pearls. Sometimes they are translucent and either pink
or of a faintly bluish tint, like molten silver. More frequently their
hue is white, rose, pale yellow, or pale copper, deepening to copper
red until they resemble the most intense and highly polished copper
button.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to the estimates of the value of European fresh-water
pearls given by seventeenth and eighteenth century writers, their worth
was considered to be one half that of oriental pearls of approximately
the same quality. Few European pearls, we feel sure, were ever found
that possessed the wonderful beauty and brilliancy of the pearls found
either in the Miami or the Mississippi and its many tributaries.</p>

<p class='c013'>So great a quantity of the poorer quality of pearls have been found,
principally in the Mississippi Valley, that a foreign dealer has bought
30,000  ounces of baroque pearls at $1 an ounce, and of the
slightly better grades fully 100,000 dollars’ worth were obtained
in the year 1906. The exportation was strictly limited to the
poorer qualities. When pearls are worth from $1 to $6 a grain
and upward, they are rarely sent abroad, as the regular pearls
of this quality are much appreciated by Americans, and find a ready
sale in the United States. The poor pearls above mentioned were principally
sent to New York, either from the local fishermen, or else
through the dealers in sweet-water shells, in lots of a fraction of an
ounce, or in bags weighing a number of pounds. Thirty thousand
ounces would equal 18,180,000 grains.</p>

<p class='c013'>After all the fine pearls have been selected—buttons, baroques,
turtle-backs, haystacks, wings, petals and other pearls that can be used
in any way as a jewel on this side of the water—the balance of the
material is sold by the ounce, varying in price from $1 to $5.
These are shipped to Germany, France, and Austria, where they are
again selected for cheaper forms of jewelry than are made in the
United States. Of these pearls the baroques and slugs go mainly to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>Germany, while the somewhat finer ones are sent to France, where
they are used in artistic but inexpensive work, such as flowers and
other imitative forms, and in <i>art nouveau</i> jewelry. Some, again, are
shipped to Algiers, Morocco, and Egypt, for the decoration of saddles,
garments, etc., and quantities go to India to be used for medicinal
purposes. In this way all the material is utilized and even the poorest
is not wasted. No better proof can be required of the wide-spread
appreciation of the pearl among all the races of mankind.</p>

<p class='c013'>So extensive has become the finding of American pearls that great
quantities have been gathered together of all varieties. At the time
of this writing there are many large single lots of these pearls, slightly
irregular, and not of fine quality, but yet of sufficient regularity of size
to be termed baroques. At one time such quantities were gotten together
that single papers of pearls, weighing one fourth, one half,
one, two or three grains each, contained more than 10,000 grains, and
quantities of the wing and dog-tooth varieties weighing as much as
20,000  grains were inclosed in a single paper.</p>

<p class='c013'>So prolific has been the yield of these common American pearls that
the markets of Europe and Asia have almost been flooded with them.
In 1906, a single shipment of 3500 ounces, troy (equaling over
2,100,000  grains), were sent abroad, at prices varying from $1 to $15
per ounce, according to the quality. This alone would represent a
worth of $30,000 at one time.</p>

<p class='c013'>The turtleback is a form quite prevalent among American pearls,
and they are often matched in pairs slightly resembling each other and
weighing from 10 to 100 or more grains for each pair. Some
of them are lustrous and many are of very good color and regular
in form. Although differing but little in shape, they naturally are
much less expensive than a finer formed pearl, and many of them
have been sold for link buttons, and more especially for earscrews.
Although they formerly sold for 50 cents a grain, they are now held at
from $1 to $8 per grain.</p>

<p class='c013'>In regard to the prices of some of the finer American pearls, one of
15 grains, of wonderful brilliancy, luster, and perfection, was
sold for more than $2500–$166 a grain, or a base value of over $11
a grain. Two extraordinarily well-matched button pearls, weighing
a trifle over 30 grains, were held at about $3500, or $115 a grain, a
base value of about $8 a grain.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the time of this writing there are for sale in the United States
a pair of button earrings, almost round, not of absolutely perfect
color, weighing about 140 grains, the price being $6000; a round,
slightly ovate pearl, not of the finest color, weighing 85 grains, held at
$3500; and a wonderful pearl with a rich, faintly pink luster, round,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>but slightly button on each side, weighing about 44 grains, and beautiful
as are American pearls, is held at a fanciful valuation of over $6000.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cupidity of many of the American pearl finders and pearl dealers
cannot be exceeded even by that of the foreign pearl finder in any
other land, and this is shown by the variety of materials that from
time to time are sold to the unsuspecting public, or that are sent to
pearl dealers in the large cities. This is surprising and suggests either
that the sender believes the pearl dealers are not familiar with these
deceptions, or else that he himself has been imposed upon, and is innocent
in his commercial deceit. Among the notable examples are, first,
spheres made out of the various shells, either from a good part of the
material or from hinge-material, or else from the spot where the
mussel is attached, these pieces of the shell being rounded and polished;
such spheres vary in color from white to pink or yellow, just as
the shell itself may have been colored. Second, the pupils of fish-eyes.
Third, imitation pearls. Fourth, yellow or brown translucent or transparent
masses of hinge-binding material having no greater hardness
than horn, and about the same appearance. The most interesting,
however, are the absolutely beautiful, smooth spheres of anthracite
coal, which admits of a rich polish and has a peculiar luster; these
they attempt to pass off as black pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is interesting to note that in Arkansas a negro sold a very valuable
pearl for a few dollars, under the persuasion of a white man, who, it
is said, resold the pearl for nearly a hundred times more than what he
paid for it. The local authorities investigated the matter; the case
was brought to court, and the negro received a large advance on the
price that had originally been paid him.</p>

<p class='c013'>If a list were kept of the thousand and one different methods of
wrapping American pearls for shipment to the larger cities, it would
show how much ingenuity is displayed in environments that frequently
differ very much from each other. A box that has contained the pills
that relieved him of fever, ague, and other ills due to swamps and
damp climates, serves a secondary purpose for the fortunate finder of
a pearl in forming a receptacle in which he can ship it to the greater
market. Sometimes they are sewed in leather cut from gloves and
shoes, or in strips of cloth, generally of the humbler varieties, such as
calico or blue jean; in other cases they are wrapped in tissue-paper
and newspaper; and occasionally they are packed in boxes made by
hollowing out a bit of wood, a cover being nailed over the opening. In
almost every instance they have been treated with a certain degree of
care.</p>

<p class='c013'>The majority of conch pearls which are carried by individuals to
New York, London, or Paris, are generally brought in small papers or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>bits of cloth, each pearl being wrapped separately. Usually, there are
a few white ones, a few yellow, a few pale pink, occasionally a few of
a very beautiful rich pink, and once in a great while a fine, large pearl
appears. Many of these pearls, commonly the inferior ones, are sold
in the West Indies directly to the tourists who wish to purchase something
in the country through which they are traveling, with the result
that better prices are generally obtained than would have been secured
if the pearls had been sent to the great markets.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tariff on pearls at present operative in the United States is so
indefinite as to have led to much serious misinterpretation and misunderstanding,
as well as to an endless chain of lawsuits, often resulting
in serious loss to the dealer or client who imports. As a consequence
of the enforced outlay of large sums for unexpected and additional
duties, the importer, who was both ready and willing to pay what
seemed to him a just duty, often found that, where he had quoted
a price to a customer, he was a loser by the transaction; and if, to
escape this loss, he endeavors to dispute the payment of the duty, he
becomes involved in an expensive and occasionally unsuccessful lawsuit.
On the other hand, a private buyer who has paid all that he feels
he can afford at the time for a necklace, expecting to pay a duty of 10
per cent. and interpreting the law to mean a duty of 10 per cent., may
be called upon to pay a duty of 60 per cent., or have the notoriety of
a public lawsuit, because the pearls have been strung, or because it is
held that they had recently or at some former time been assembled as
a necklace. In other words, if the pearls constituting such a necklace
are bought at various times from various people, either here or in
Europe, and not as a necklace, the duty is held to be 10 per cent., but
if they are sent in one shipment, a duty of 60 per cent. is levied. As
it is held that pearls assembled in the form of a necklace have a greater
value than before they were so assembled, the purchaser might naturally
expect to pay the 10 per cent. duty on this higher value, but instead of
this a 60 per cent. duty is demanded on the higher assembled value.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ambiguity of this clause of the tariff is such that a logical ruling
should be made by some superior official such as the Secretary of the
Treasury. As the law is now interpreted, a pearl worth $20,000 can
be brought in with a duty of 10 per cent.; the addition of a simple
gold wire makes it a piece of jewelry, with a duty of 60 per cent. It
would seem that an amendment might be made to the tariff by which
an importer, whether a private buyer or dealer, could be called upon to
pay a 60 per cent. duty on a high valuation of the setting of the ring,
brooch, or jewel, such as $20, $25 or $50; while the contents of
the ring or ornament, whether a pearl, diamond, emerald, or a
collection of stones, should pay a duty of only 10 per cent. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>duty would sufficiently protect the jewelry industry, and would at the
same time prevent the levying of an unjust and unexpected impost
upon a fine pearl or gem of any kind.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is eminently desirable that those residing in the United States who
purchase pearls in foreign countries, should, if possible, consult with
the United States consul in the city where they make their purchase,
in case they wish to bring the pearls into the United States. In this
way a proper declaration can be made, they will be correctly instructed
as to the duties upon the pearls, whether unstrung, strung, or set, and
they will thus avoid all complications when they reach the United
States. Of course, this may not be necessary should the firm with
which they are dealing be able to attend to the matter for them.</p>

<p class='c013'>It must not be forgotten that the duty of 25 per cent. on
precious stones, which was imposed during Cleveland’s administration,
was enacted for the purpose of obtaining an increased revenue
for the government, and there is no doubt but that the time was one
of great financial stress. Yet even with the duty two and a half times
as high as in the previous years, only a small fraction was added to
the income of the Government. But one adequate explanation can be
given of this remarkable decrease in the recorded imports, more especially
when we consider that legitimate dealers could, at that time, buy
precious stones in New York City for less than it cost them to purchase
them abroad and pay the duty. It seems, therefore, that a 10
per cent. rate is calculated to produce the best and most satisfactory
results in every way.</p>

<p class='c013'>As examples of the difficulties encountered in the attempt to arrive
at a proper classification of pearls we cite the following cases which
have been the subjects of recent litigation: In 1901, two very valuable
collections of pearls were brought to this country. One of these consisted
of 45 drilled pearls weighing in all 672⅛ grains and entered
at $60,734; the other, of 39 pearls, having an aggregate
weight of 678¾ grains and entered at $63,070. At first a duty of 20
per cent. ad valorem was imposed upon these pearls under Section 6 of
the Tariff Act, treating them as “unenumerated articles partly manufactured,”
according to the rule that had been followed since the enactment
of the present tariff. This was protested, and the case was
brought before the Board of Appraisers.<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c017'><sup>[407]</sup></a> Subsequent to the protest,
however, the collector reliquidated the entry of the 45 pearls
and imposed upon them a duty of 60 per cent. ad valorem, as pearls set
or strung. This was done in view of Judge Lacombe’s decision in another
notable case which had been taken shortly before to the Circuit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>Court of Appeals.<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c017'><sup>[408]</sup></a> This decision was to the effect that pearls in any
form not especially covered by paragraphs 434 or 436 of the Tariff
Act should be referred to one or the other of those paragraphs, by similitude,
according to the provisions of Section 7 of the Act.</p>

<p class='c013'>The testimony taken before the Board of Appraisers revealed the
fact that each of the collections of pearls had been inclosed in a handsome
silk-lined morocco case, with a groove running through the center;
in this groove the pearls were laid, the largest one in the middle
and the others disposed on either side, graduated according to their
size; the row or series having the effect of a necklace, although the
pearls were unstrung. The importer testified that this arrangement
was only made in order to enable him to judge of the size and quality
of the pearls, and evidence was given showing that it was necessary to
rebore some of them and to ream out the holes before any use could be
made of the pearls in jewelry. Nevertheless, the appraisers adhered
to their opinion that these gems had been selected especially to form a
necklace, and that the time and labor requisite for the assembling of a
carefully matched and graduated series of pearls suitable for a necklace
constituted the main factor in its production, since the cost of
stringing it was trifling; they, therefore, considered that such a series
of pearls was dutiable, by similitude, under paragraph 434 of the Tariff
Act as jewelry. An application was made to the Circuit Court of
the Southern District of New York for a review of the appraisers’ ruling,<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c017'><sup>[409]</sup></a>
the judge decided against the petitioner,<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c017'><sup>[410]</sup></a> and an appeal was then
taken from his decision. On December 12, 1904, the Circuit Court of
Appeals decided that the pearls were dutiable, by similitude, at 10 per
cent. ad valorem, under Section 7, paragraph 436, and the excess of
duty collected was refunded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another case has to do with a collection of 37 pearls, entered at
$220,000, brought to New York in January, 1906. Duty to the
amount of $22,000 (10 per cent. ad valorem) was paid by the importer,
but the entry was liquidated at 60 per cent. and $110,000 additional
duty demanded. This was paid and a protest was made to the Board
of General Appraisers, who decided in favor of the petitioner. The
Government appealed and the case<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c017'><sup>[411]</sup></a> was tried in the United States
Circuit Court on February 24 of this year (1908). It was shown
that the pearls had been worn several times in Paris as a necklace, but
the defense held that, as they were loose when imported and were not
worth more collectively than separately, this was not material. The
judge decided for the Government and an appeal has been taken in
June, 1908.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>The proper classification of half-pearls has also been a matter of
controversy. This question was brought before the Board of General
Appraisers in New York on a protest<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c017'><sup>[412]</sup></a> entered in 1897 against the imposition
of a duty of 20 per cent. on several lots of so-called half-pearls
imported during that year. This duty was imposed under Section 6 of
the Tariff Act, providing for a duty of 20 per cent. on “unenumerated
partly manufactured articles.” The petitioner claimed that half-pearls
were dutiable at 10 per cent. ad valorem, “either directly or by
similitude or component of chief value, under paragraph 436, or as
precious stones, under paragraph 435 of the Tariff Act.” After hearing
the testimony of a number of competent and reliable experts connected
with some of the leading houses dealing in precious stones and
pearls, the appraisers decided that the evidence showed that pearls, being
the product of animal secretion, could not properly be denominated
stones, and that they were not in fact so designated commercially. At
the same time, half-pearls could not be looked upon as “pearls in their
natural state,” since time and labor had been expended in their production;
it was, therefore, evident that paragraph 436 did not apply to
them. For this reason the original ruling was reaffirmed.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1902 a duty of 60 per cent. was levied on an assorted lot of half-pearls
under a new ruling which brought them by similitude under the
provisions of paragraph 434 of the Tariff Act, providing a duty of
60 per cent. on “jewelry&nbsp;... including&nbsp;... pearls set or strung.” A
protest was entered against this ruling also.<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c017'><sup>[413]</sup></a> In the meanwhile Judge
Lacombe had given the opinion to which we have alluded above, and
the Board of Appraisers upheld the duty of 60 per cent., basing their
decision upon the fact that the material of half-pearls was similar to
that of pearls in their natural state or of pearls set or strung, thus satisfying
the requirements as to similitude of Section 7 of the Tariff Act.
The same section provides that, in case two or more rates of duty shall
be applicable to any imported article, it shall pay duty at the highest
rate, and therefore the 60–per cent. rate applying to pearls set or
strung was imposed, instead of the 10–per cent. rate on pearls in their
natural state. In both of these cases an application for a review was
made to the United States Circuit Court.<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c017'><sup>[414]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>There are several things that are essential in pearl buying, and one
of the most important of these is that the light in which the pearls are
selected shall be absolutely pure daylight, with no reflections from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>side or from above that can enhance or detract from the color of the
pearl. This must be carefully considered, as it is not uncommon—more
especially in certain parts of Europe—that jewelers have for
their selling-offices rooms sumptuously fitted up with hangings of different
colors, and sometimes with ground glass windows, provided
with heavy silk hangings, so that artificial light becomes a necessity
to make the article sold plainly visible. In absolutely pure daylight,
more especially with an unclouded sky—on such days as are probably
more frequent in the United States than in some of the European
countries—it is possible to see the exact tint or color of the pearls; that
is, whether it is really a pure white with a tinge of pink or an orient
tending to cream-white, or whether it is more or less tinted with what
is considered a crude or red color in a pearl. Besides this, in a pure
light it is possible to see whether the pearl is brilliant, and to estimate
the exact degree of its brilliancy; whether there are any cracks,
scratches, or mars on the surface; and, lastly, whether the form is
entirely regular. If one should select two necklaces, one absolutely
perfect and the other having slight blemishes as to color or brilliancy,
or with breaks, marks, or irregularities, these two necklaces would be
scarcely distinguishable from each other in artificial light, or in daylight
which had been partly confused with artificial light; although
the differences between the two would signify that the former was
worth two or three times as much as the latter.</p>

<p class='c013'>At great receptions, large, and apparently magnificent pearls are
frequently seen, which are really of inferior quality, and yet, owing to
the absence of pure daylight, they can easily be mistaken for perfect
specimens by any one not especially familiar with pearls. Indeed, if
the royalties of Europe should wear all the pearls belonging to the
crown jewels at the same time, in a palace or hall lighted with candles,
gas, or even with some types of electric light, they would frequently
seem to have a quality which many of them do not and never did possess.
It is, therefore, essential for the buyer to use every precaution
in reference to the light in which he examines his purchase. And we
may add that it is just as essential that he should know the dealer from
whom he buys; for, sometimes, after a few weeks or months, cracks or
blemishes develop that were not apparent at first, more especially when
the pearls have been “improved” for a prospective purchaser.</p>

<p class='c013'>A test to ascertain the quality of pearls is quaintly expressed in a
work published in 1778, as follows:</p>

<p class='c020'>How to know good pearls. To discover the hidden Defects and Faults
of a Pearl and to know whether she is speckled or broken or has any other
imperfections, the best way is to make trial of it by the Reverberation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>Sun-beams; for by this means your eye will penetrate into the very Centre of
the Pearl and discover the least defect it has; you will then see whether it be
pure, or has any spots or not, and consequently you may the better guess its
value.<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c017'><sup>[415]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>If you can cause a ray of sunlight or of electric light to fall on a
pearl, the light will penetrate it and show any specks, inclosed blemishes
or impurities. This can probably best be done by wrapping about
the pearl a dark cloth of velvet or other material and having the ray
fall slantingly, whereby the defects are much more clearly shown than
if the ray be allowed to fall directly upon the gem.</p>

<p class='c013'>A pearl necklace valued at $200,000, shown at one of our recent
great expositions, was to all appearances a remarkably beautiful collection,
and it was only when the intending purchaser took them
from their velvet bed and held them in his hands that he realized
that there was not a perfect pearl in the entire collection. It must
have taken more than a week of study for the clever dealer to arrange
them so that the best part, sometimes the only good part of each pearl,
should be where the eye would fall upon it. After they had been
turned in the hands a few seconds, not one perfect specimen was
visible.</p>

<p class='c013'>The demand for pearls has been so great, and the enhancement of
value so rapid, that the greatest ingenuity has been employed in presenting
the best part of the gems to view, as well as in many other
ways. The result is that when pearls are to be used as borders or as a
gallery on a comb or brooch, they are pierced in such a way that only
the best side shall be outward, so that the general effect produced is
that of a perfect row of pearls; but a careful examination may show
that two thirds or three fourths of them are irregular, and bear abrasion
marks, indentations, or other imperfections.</p>

<p class='c013'>Following the analogy of the well-known precious stones—the
diamond, the ruby, the sapphire, the emerald and those of less importance—the
pearl is equally potent in creating great and permanent
values for itself in catering to the human love of adornment; and
though these large values may be greatly in excess of the original
price that it commanded in the native oriental market, yet the increased
valuation gives profitable livelihood to hundreds of thousands
of persons. These embrace the dealers who sell the original pearls in
lots, those who clean and treat them, others who drill and string them,
and others again who handle them in setting jewelry of all kinds, and
also the large number of dealers throughout the entire world who
sell either the jewelry or the unmounted pearls. Directly connected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>with the industry in localities where the fisheries are pursued are a
sufficient number of persons to populate a city the size of Boston, and
to these we may safely add an equal number as herein noted, aggregating
about 1,000,000 people whose livelihood is directly dependent
upon the production and traffic of the pearl industry, and who for lack
of it would be forced to seek some other employment. Brought thus
to a concrete form, one may readily grasp the important bearing which
the pearl has in a comprehensive estimate of the complexity of the
world’s civilization as we know it to-day.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c027'>The pearl is at the height of its perfection when taken from
the shell; from that moment it never improves. When it is
drawn from the depths of the ocean by the hand of man and
given to the charmed gaze of the world, it is as complete
and perfect in its way as the most beautiful work of art, and, whether
as tiny as the point of a pin or as large as a marble, it is always a
perfect, fully formed individual; it is always in its maturity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Who found the first pearl? When did he discover it, and what
were his emotions? Was it found by primitive man? Very likely
it was discovered by chance in a mother-of-pearl shell cast up by the
sea, or perhaps in a mussel in a brook. If this happened in an oriental
country, the native must have already seen many equally remarkable
objects, endowed with life, while the pearl could charm him only by
its luster and purity. But, besides the impression produced by its
beauty, it must have aroused in the soul of the discoverer the sensation
of wonder which every new and lovely object excites when seen
for the first time. That primitive man appreciated the pearl is evidenced
by the fact that it is found in the mounds and graves of the
American continent, from the State of Ohio to Peru in South America.</p>

<p class='c013'>Almost all pearls are in perfect condition for setting when they are
found; all that needs to be done is to rub them with a damp or moist
cloth or with a powder of finely pulverized small or broken pearls, and
they are then ready for the succeeding processes. If there are any
blemishes, these can be removed by peeling or “faking,” although few
fine pearls require any such treatment; and then the gems may be
drilled, strung, and set, and all that is necessary for their preservation
is due care and attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls are frequently injured in opening the shells or in removal of
the outer layers around the true pearly nacre. Both the Chinese and
the Sulu fishermen are very clever in the art of pearl peeling and pearl
improving. This method is called “faking,” although it is a perfectly
legitimate operation. All it requires is a very sharp knife, a set of
files, and a powder obtained by grinding pearls or pearl shells. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>powder is placed upon a buffer of leather or cloth to polish such parts
of a layer as may not have been entirely removed. The Chinese are
unusual adepts in pearl peeling and have been frequently known to sell
as true pearls scales that they have removed, after filling these scales
or peelings with wax or shellac, and strengthening them by cementing
them on a piece of mother-of-pearl. They are then set with the convex
side up and the edges carefully covered so as to conceal the deception.
The Chinese are also very expert in removing layers of mother-of-pearl
from an encysted or buried pearl, taking off layer after layer
with the greatest care, and with a delicacy of touch that enables them
to realize the moment when the pearl itself has been reached, rarely injuring
the latter, although the coating is almost as hard as the inclosed
pearl.</p>

<p class='c013'>Peeling is employed to remove a protuberance or acid stain, to
smooth a surface broken by abrasion, or to take off a dead spot produced
by careless wearing of the pearls and allowing them to rub
against one another. There are many instances where, by careful
peeling, a perfect layer and skin have been brought to light, and where
irregular or broken pearls, or those with a blemish, have been rendered
much more valuable by a good peeler. But in many other cases
the pearl has not only been reduced in value, but even rendered altogether
worthless, when it had a dead center or was pitted with clay or
other impurities.</p>

<p class='c013'>If a pearl has been injured by coming in contact with the acids frequently
used in medicine, the surface may become roughened; or it
may be scratched by being rubbed against a stone in case of a fall or
other accident. If the surface only is injured, it can be restored to its
original beauty with only a slight loss of weight by carefully peeling
off the outer layers.</p>

<p class='c013'>In skinning or peeling a pearl, a magnifying glass, or preferably a
fixed lens, such as is used by engravers, is of great assistance, and a
sharp knife, or, better still, the sharpened edge of a steel file, is a very
essential instrument. Gloves are often worn by the peeler so that no
perspiration shall reach the pearl and cause it to slip in the hand while
it is being manipulated, and thus have a layer or more injured by the
knife.</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>Streeter mentions a very interesting incident in regard to a genuine
black pearl. This pearl, set with diamonds, was shown in a jeweler’s
window; but after exposure in this way for some time to the sun’s
rays, the brilliant black luster disappeared and gave place to a dull,
grayish hue. When the pearl was removed from its setting, it was seen
that the part which had not been exposed to the light was of as good
color as when first removed from the shell. It was finally determined
to skin off the outer layer, an operation which was performed with so
much success that the original brilliant black hue was fully restored,
proving that the action of the sunlight had only changed the color of
the surface. We may add that the pearl, although it was shown in
the sun, may never have had a good “skin” or layer exposed; or the
layer which was not perfect may have been affected by an exudation
of the wearer produced by illness or medicine.</p>

<p class='c013'>When pearls are of a poor yellow or dull brown tint, unscrupulous
dealers sometimes intrust them to an operator who drills them almost
entirely through, cracks the skin slightly and impregnates them with a
solution of nitrate of silver; this affects the outer layers of the pearls,
and, after its decomposition, the metallic silver is deposited, and they
become absolutely black. The effect is sometimes hastened by exposing
them to the fumes of nitrate of silver. These pearls are then
rubbed up or slightly polished and may retain a good appearance for
a number of years. The upper layers, however, which have been injured
by the chemicals used in the coloring, often scale off, and the
poor and unattractive color beneath appears. This is sometimes not
detected until years after and when the dealer from whom they were
purchased has been forgotten. The breaks or cracks which have been
made can readily be detected by means of a pocket lens, if the observer
is at all experienced. In many cases the outer layer of the pearl has
been colored a good black, although scarcely any crack is visible.</p>

<p class='c013'>Frequently, when a small knob or protuberance appears in the pearl,
or when it has adhered to another pearl or to the shell itself, this protuberance
is polished off, and the pearl is drilled at this point. This
portion of the surface, however carefully polished, will never have
the true orient, but it is placed in the necklace in such a way that it is
completely hidden. Often pearls become scratched through rough
usage, or by the knife used in opening the shells. These are occasionally
polished by means of pearl-powder, or else the entire outer
layer is removed, the new skin beneath appearing absolutely bright
and perfect. It sometimes happens that a pearl will have a good
luster, but a slightly roughened skin. This is at times polished
down; but an experienced eye easily detects that it has been
tampered with. Yellowish pearls are sometimes bleached by means
of strong bleaching substances such as chlorine or other powerful
reagents, which, although they may whiten the pearl, cause it to become
very friable, as the animal substance becomes more brittle.
Pearls treated in this way frequently wear off, layer by layer, until
fully one half of the pearl is worn out of the setting. When pearls
are stained yellowish from the exudations of the skin, grease, or other
impurities, they can be cleaned by putting them in moist caustic magnesia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>and allowing it to dry on them. When this is removed, the pearls
will often be found much purer in color than before.</p>

<p class='c013'>In various parts of the world certain dubious methods have been
used for restoring the beauty of pearls which have grown dim. In
India they are rubbed in boiled rice. Some persons have even fed
them to a chicken fastened in a coop; after the lapse of an hour or two
the chicken is killed, and the pearls rescued from their temporary lodging-place,
where they have been somewhat restored by the digestive
juices of the fowl.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some curious tests applied to pearls are given us in a Hindu treatise
on gems by Buddhabhatta. For instance, we read: “If the purchaser
conceives a doubt as to the genuineness of a pearl, let him place it
during one night in a mixture of water and oil with salt, and heat it.
Or let him wrap it in a dry cloth and rub it with grains of rice; if it do
not become discolored, it should be regarded as genuine.”<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c017'><sup>[416]</sup></a> It is needless
to state that these tests would be either useless or injurious.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the reader is the owner of a pearl or of a pearl necklace and feels
that the pearls need treatment, any attempt to follow the directions
given by many ancient writers would infallibly result in their injury or
destruction.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearl drilling is a most delicate operation. It is necessary that the
drill points should have the proper shape,—that is, should not be too
tapering, but slightly blunt at the end, and turning somewhat in a
V-shape,—it is also important that the drill should be revolved with
perfect regularity, so as not to jar or jolt the pearl, as this is likely to
lead to the cracking of the pearl or to the breaking of the drill. This
latter happens not infrequently, and is due either to the structure of
the pearl, the clogging of the drill, or to encountering a hard grain of
sand inclosed in the pearl. Should the drill break in the pearl, it can
best be removed by drilling from a point directly opposite, and slowly
forcing the broken drill outward. This process requires great care
in the regulation of the speed, and great exactness of direction in order
to meet the broken drill accurately.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearl drilling was formerly a laborious process, and it was scarcely
possible for a driller to perforate more than from forty to fifty pearls
per day by means of the bow-drill operated by hand. Now, by the use
of a modern machine, 1500 pearls of average size can be drilled without
any difficulty in the same time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of the most successful drilling of fine pearls is done by means
of the bow- or fiddle-drill. The arm of this is made either of steel
or of wood, with a strong cord stretched across it in the style of an
archer’s bow. The drill is inserted in the end of a brass circular disk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>with a V-shaped groove on its edge, to admit of the string being passed
entirely around it like a pulley, so that when the drill is placed on anything
and held at the other side, and the bow is moved up and down,
the wheel with the drill-end rotates rapidly.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the pearl is not properly secured, if the drill point is too irregular,
if it is not properly centered, or if it is too rapidly rotated at the start,
one or more layers of the pearl are likely to be broken, giving an irregular,
ragged appearance. If, again, the drill is rotated too rapidly as
it is leaving the other side of the pearl, one or more layers are occasionally
forced off, and this in turn will produce a break on the pearl.
It happens not infrequently that pearls are broken away on the surfaces
at both drill holes if the workman is careless.</p>

<p class='c013'>As pearls have become more valuable, only the most efficient workmen
are employed in drilling them. Whereas formerly a drill hole
would be half a millimeter in diameter, at present it is much smaller,
and such drilling requires the greatest skill in manipulation. The use
of these very fine drill holes is due principally to the fact that pearls
have become so valuable that the slightest loss, even the fraction of
a grain, would amount to a considerable sum in a necklace of large
pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>When a pearl has been perforated with a very fine drill hole, the
hole may be enlarged somewhat by using a slender copper wire, the
fineness of the drill hole itself, charged with either diamond-dust,
emery, or sand. When the wire thus charged is drawn in and out,
the drill hole can be enlarged to any desired size.</p>

<p class='c013'>A large pearl is held in the hand or secured in a wooden block, or
else it is held in a small pair of forceps with a rounded, cup-shaped
receptacle at the end, which is usually lined with chamois leather and
is pierced with a hole through the center. This hole serves as a guide
for the drill, directing it while the pearl is being perforated. Adjustable
cups or forceps with cup-like ends of every size are necessary,
according to the size of the pearl; and in order that it may be properly
seen, it is requisite that the pearl should always be larger than the cup
in which it is placed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The poorest part or spot is selected to form the beginning of the
drill hole. The pearl is placed in a pair of calipers with a circular
disk, one end of the caliper being placed on the spot to be pierced, the
other end naturally touching exactly opposite, the pearl absolutely centering
it. As these caliper ends have been rubbed with either rouge,
lampblack, or some colored substance that will readily rub off, these
two spots of color remain on the pearl and serve as a guide for the
driller. The drill end is then placed on the pearl, and the bow moved
up and down; and so rapid is this work that five pearls weighing fifteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>grains each can be drilled with the greatest care in less than one hour’s
time. Of small pearls, weighing about one grain, as many as fifty
have been drilled in less than one hour by the hand-drill method.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many of the thinnest and best drills are made out of thin steel
needles. These are ground flat by means of a small carborundum
wheel, so as to have two flat sides. They are then thin pointed, and
with a V-shaped edge. These prevent the drill from clogging up,
allowing the fine dust to pass upward and outward readily, and the
hard steel almost invariably penetrates the central core of the pearl,
no matter how hard or tough this may be. The needle-drill is then
secured in a small chuck attached to the brass revolving wheel.
Some recommend lubricating a drill with milk when it is employed
for piercing a pearl, but a well-made drill, that allows the dust to
escape as it is formed, does not require this treatment. The drill
should always be made to revolve quite slowly so that no unnecessary
heat may be generated by friction to injure the color of the pearl
and also to avoid the possibility of the drill becoming clogged by the
pearl-dust.</p>

<p class='c013'>By means of centering calipers or markers, the driller, especially in
the drilling of a large pearl, will generally drill first from one end,
and then reverse the pearl and drill from the other end, meeting absolutely
in the center. This prevents the breaking of the outer layer of
the pearl. A skilful workman can, by turning the pearl, so operate the
calipers that the true center can be obtained, even if the pearl is not
absolutely round, and the drill holes so centered that the irregularity
of the pearl is less apparent.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the pearl has been half drilled through from one side, considerable
caution is necessary in drilling from the other, that when the
two drill holes are about meeting the drill be not revolved too rapidly,
as the clogging is likely to crack the pearl or break the drill. If the
pearl is only to be drilled one fourth or one half through, the depth can
always be gaged by watching the drill-end, first, by measuring the
drill-end itself, and, secondly, by noting to what part of it pearl-powder
adheres.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls are more easily manipulated than any other gems. They are
also more easily damaged. Still, when properly treated by the workman,
there is no material that offers him more satisfactory results than
the pearl, if good judgment be used.</p>

<p class='c013'>Drillers occasionally find that when the drill reaches the center of
the pearl, there is a sharp click, the pearl often breaking at this point.
This is evidently due to the fact that a harder kernel may exist in the
center, such as a tiny grain of sand, which can turn the drill point; or
else the resistance may cause the tiny drill to break.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>When a pearl is cracked by a blow or by some accident, it is customary
to drill it at the end of the largest crack; this method prevents
the crack from extending in that direction. These fissures
are sometimes partly filled by means of a solution, and may not be visible
at the time when the pearl is bought, but they are liable to appear
later.</p>

<p class='c013'>To illustrate the difference in the care used in drilling, we have
selected eight pearls from a paper of poor ones, and reproduce two
views of them, one to show the irregularity of the pearls, and the other
to show the varying size of the drill holes. Those on the left were
drilled by an artist, while those on the right show the work of an inexperienced
driller.</p>

<p class='c013'>At present pendant pearls are never drilled entirely through, and
rarely more than half way. But in the Orient, and even in Europe from
the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, they were often entirely
pierced; even pear-shaped pearls were entirely drilled through, with a
metal edge projected below for safety. Frequently old pearls, and more
especially oriental pearls, have been entirely drilled through, as are
often large oriental rubies, diamonds, and sapphires. When these are
set, the holes are either plugged with pearl shell and polished smooth,
or a tiny ruby or diamond is set in a metal rim fitting entirely into
the drill hole or only slightly projecting. This is well instanced in
the portrait of Marguerite of France (1553–1615), in which the
artist Delpech shows all the pear-shaped pearls worn by the French
queen entirely pierced.</p>

<p class='c013'>Frequently, where pearls have been drilled by oriental workmen, the
drill holes are exceedingly large, five or six times the width of the silk
string; in fact often from one to two millimeters in diameter. In the
search to supply the great demand, many oriental pearls have been
secured which formerly were strung to an oriental jewel by means of
a thick wire; it is necessary to close this aperture, as the pearl would
lie unevenly on the string. This is done by introducing a mother-of-pearl
plug, through which a new drill hole is made. Unless the pearls
are unstrung, this is rarely visible; but not infrequently the plug drops
out. In other cases the pearl has been drilled not only from end to
end, but also from the side, and this third hole is filled with a plug of
mother-of-pearl and polished over so as to hide the blemish from the
buyer. It is also no uncommon thing for a purchaser to find, after a
year, that cracks begin to develop where none apparently existed at the
time of his purchase, or they were so minute as to be considered of no
consequence.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the earliest references to drilling pearls was made by Rugerus,
a monk who lived in the eleventh century. He says:</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>Pearls are found in the sea-shell and shells of other waters; these are perforated
with a fine steeled instrument which is fixed in wood, having a small
wheel of lead, also another wood in which it may be turned, to which a strap
must be placed by which it may be revolved. But should it be necessary that
the aperture of any pearl be made larger, a wire may be placed in the opening
with a little fine sand, one end of which may be held in the teeth, the other in
the left hand, and by the right the pearl is conducted upwards and downwards,
and in the meantime sand is applied, that the apertures may become
wider. Sea-shells are also cut into pieces and are filed as pearls, sufficiently
useful upon gold, and they are polished as above.<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c017'><sup>[417]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In “The Toy Cart,” a Hindu drama by Sudrake, who lived about the
beginning of the Christian era, there is a description of a jeweler’s
workshop attached to the house of a courtezan. He says: “Some set
rubies in gold, some string gold beads on colored thread, some string
pearls, some grind lapis lazuli, some cut shells and some grind and
pierce coral.”<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c017'><sup>[418]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The Chinese and Korean method of drilling pearls differs materially
from that of the Occident. A pear-shaped pearl is frequently drilled
horizontally and secured by wire or silk, and not drilled perpendicularly,
as with us, to have a metal wire or peg fastened into it. If the
orientals drill a pearl perpendicularly, the hole is generally carried entirely
through it, and a gold knot, which is used as a bead, is placed at
the lower end, and sometimes a tiny gem is set in this peg, or else the
pearl is secured either by some projection below, or by means of a bit
of enamel, or some other object may be attached to the gold or wire
below it. Button pearls, especially those of the abalone, are drilled
horizontally through the base and secured to the ornament, or to the
silk or other material on which they are sewed, by means of a thread
or wire; or else they may be drilled from below by means of two sloping
holes forming a V, the thread or wire being passed upward until
it strikes the angle, and then passed outward again through the other
branch of the hole. Many fine, round, and pear-shaped pearls of
oriental origin may be seen with this end closed either with a speck of
pearl, a diamond, or a ruby.</p>

<p class='c013'>A most interesting and careful description of the methods of
drilling pearls was given by James Cordiner in his valuable volume,
“A Description of Ceylon,” published in London in 1807, pages
64–66.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>The next operation which claims attention is the drilling of the pearls. I
neglected to inspect this part of the business; but have been informed that
much admiration is excited, both by the dexterity of the artist, and the rude
simplicity of the machinery which he employs. A block of wood, of the form
of an inverted cone, is raised upon three feet about twelve inches from the
ground. Small holes or pits of various sizes are cut in the upper flat surface,
for the reception of the pearls. The driller sits on his haunches close to this
machine, which is called a vadeagrum. The pearls are driven steady into their
sockets by a piece of iron with flat sides, about one inch and a half in length.
A well tempered needle is fixed in a reed five inches long, with an iron point
at the other end, formed to play in the socket of a cocoanut shell, which
presses on the forehead of the driller. A bow is formed of a piece of bamboo
and a string. The workman brings his right knee in a line with the vadeagrum,
and places on it a small cup, formed of part of a cocoanut shell, which
is filled with water to moderate the heat of friction. He bends his head over
the machine, and applying the point of the needle to a pearl sunk in one of the
pits, drills with great facility, every now and then dexterously dipping the
little finger of his right hand in the water, and applying it to the needle, without
impeding the operation. In this manner he bores a pearl in the space of
two or three minutes; and in the course of a day perforates three hundred
small or six hundred large pearls. The needle is frequently sharpened with
oil on a stone slab, and sometimes, before the operation is performed, is
heated in the flame of a lamp.</p>

<p class='c020'>The large pearls are generally drilled first, in order to bring the hand in to
work with more ease on those of a smaller size; and pearls less than a grain
of mustard-seed are pierced with little difficulty.</p>

<p class='c020'>After the pearls have been drilled, they must be immediately washed in
salt and water, to prevent the stains which would otherwise be occasioned by
the perforating instrument.</p>

<p class='c013'>A quaint description of pearl drilling was given by Anselmus de
Boot in 1609.<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c017'><sup>[419]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c020'>Since all are not aware of the manner in which pearls are perforated, I wish
here to give an account of the method. The handle. A, is held with the left
hand, and then the handle, B, of the bow is pushed back and forth with
the right hand, so that there is a reciprocal movement of the lance AC. The
extreme end, C, has a needle, not so sharp as to come to a point, but slightly
blunted. The needle is placed on the pearl which is to be perforated. If the
pearls are too small to be held, they are fastened in the case, D, with a small
hammer of soft wood, lest they should slip. The board is inclosed on every
side by strips of wood so that the water which comes from the pearls shall not
flow off. The bow being moved, the needle penetrates and pierces the pearl
and it is not corroded by the water.</p>

<p class='c013'>A mythical story, but a pleasant one, is told of a great pearl collector
who had owned a wonderful pear-shaped pearl for many years and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>had absolutely failed to find any match for it. After years of fruitless
search he was at last rewarded by finding an absolutely perfect
mate. He took this to his favorite jeweler in one of the great
capitals of Europe, and ordered the new gem to be pierced to match
the other so that both could be set. The jeweler called a small German
boy from an adjoining workshop, simply saying, “Jakey, drill this pearl
to match the other.” The collector was dumfounded that no caution
should be given to the boy when so important a piece of work was
intrusted to his care. Scarcely had the boy left the room when the collector
inquired of the jeweler, almost in consternation, “How can you
trust so valuable a pearl to so small a boy without a word of caution?”
To this the dealer replied: “Jakey is the most careful pearl driller I
have ever known. I know that there will be no failure in the drilling.
I have never cautioned him about such work. He never has drilled a
pearl wrong. Had I warned him of the value of the gem or told him
how important a piece of work he was doing, he probably would have
become nervous and, as a result, your pearl would have been cracked.”
The conversation had scarcely been completed before Jakey returned
with the pearl as beautifully drilled as the original one which it
matched.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Orient and elsewhere, when it is considered desirable to mount
a pearl so that it shall not turn, especially when only one part of
the pearl is perfect and that is to remain outside, the drill hole is sometimes
made square, that is to say, drilled round and then reamed
out with a small saw until it becomes square, when a square wire
is inserted; or else the pearl is first drilled with a tiny round hole
and this is then reamed out until it is triangular, when a triangular
wire is introduced. This method is sometimes used for studs or ring-settings.</p>

<p class='c013'>In setting pearls with points or claws on the wire or band of a ring,
the pearls are drilled only half way through. A gold pin is then inserted,
and sometimes a thread is cut into the pearl itself; it is secured
by means of gum mastic or some other strong gum. Occasionally, to
add greater strength, a side pin is put in, so that the pearl is drilled
with two bits of metal, which penetrate the one side in a perfectly
straight line and the other at an angle of about twenty-five or thirty
degrees (this is called side-pegging). This gives more strength and
firmness to the pearl itself, and prevents it from twisting or twining
and becoming loose. Sometimes the pearl hole is drilled so that the
opening is that of a screw-thread, in order to hold it to the earring,
the stud, or the ring. The gold pin which is inserted to attach the
pearl to the ring or stud has a screw-thread also, and the peg or pin is
screwed on as well as secured.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>An ingenious method, termed “keying,” for securing the peg in
pearls to be set on rings or studs, consists in drilling a hole half
through the pearl and then two smaller holes or grooves on each side
of the first. Cutting tools of a T-shape are now introduced into the
aperture and worked about until the pearl is undercut all around, so
that when a peg with a cross-piece is inserted, the latter can be turned
within the pearl until it sets at right angles with the widest part of the
aperture. In this way the peg is permanently secured and cannot slip
out.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fact that in recent years more pearls have appeared in necklaces
that are irregularly bored, that the bore holes are so large that
they are plugged with mother-of-pearl, or that one meets with pearls
in which a plug has been placed in the side immediately in the center
between the two drill holes, is due to the fact that the great demand
has resulted in the destruction of many oriental ornaments in which
the pearls were drilled in various ways, as well as in the destruction of
the different Magyar and other semi-official jewels of eastern Europe.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most primitive known drills were the flint drills, made by the
North American Indians by chipping chert or flint-like minerals to a
fine point. With these rude instruments a large, irregular hole was
made, which generally measured several times the diameter of the fine
drill hole made by a modern pearl driller with an improved drill. The
Indians are also said to have used hot copper drills for boring holes.</p>

<p class='c013'>The earliest, and still a very general and perhaps the best way of
drilling pearls, is by means of the bow- or fiddle-drill. This method
has been used in a more or less perfected form by all the aboriginal
peoples of the New World from Iceland to Tierra del Fuego. But as
none of these peoples were familiar with fine, hard steel, they scarcely
ever succeeded in making drill holes as fine as those that can be produced
by the use of tempered steel. By the latter means, pearls half
an inch in diameter are often drilled entirely through with an aperture
no larger than a thin bit of straw.</p>

<p class='c013'>The largest and finest pearls are frequently drilled with the smallest
holes, as the slightest loss in weight means a diminution in value.
Then, too, a pearl with a small drill hole is not so liable to shift on the
string, and thus is less likely to cut the silk thread which holds the
pearls together.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would be difficult to enumerate all the tricks to which some jewelers
now resort in order to utilize every fragment of a pearl they can
lay their hands on. Some of them are wonderfully clever at reconstruction,
but to the woman who loves pearls, nothing can take the
place of the soft, beautiful, round gem, with its natural surface.</p>

<p class='c013'>In sorting pearls for the smaller necklaces, it is customary to open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>up a number of dozen bunches of the East Indian pearls as they are
sent from the East, strung, the ends fastened together in bunches, and
then sealed. These pearls are placed on a table and are first arranged
according to color and luster on the sorting board. They are then
grouped according to size and graduation, the greatest care being exercised
in the selection for color, luster, and form. In this way ten
necklaces may be re-strung into ten others, the necklaces probably being
improved as regards selection, or else better arranged for the uses
to which the jeweler wishes to put them.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the case of the larger necklaces, it frequently requires many years
of selection and arrangement before one becomes perfect enough to
pass the criticism or suit the fancy of the jeweler.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have no record as to when the first pearl necklace was strung,
nor have we a definite record of the first use of silk for stringing a
necklace. The earliest illustration that we have been able to obtain of
the use of pearls in the form of a necklace is the one from Susa, in
which the pearls were secured with gold. A Syrian necklace, dating
about one or two centuries before Christ, was strung by means of a
bronze wire. We will endeavor to give a few facts on the interesting
process of preparing pearls for wearing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearl stringing is an art, easy as the process may seem, and it is
interesting to note the precision, care, and delicacy with which the
pearl stringer performs his task. The first step is to grade the pearls
according to their size and color, so that they may produce the best
possible effect. The largest and finest pearl is placed in the center;
alongside of this, on each side, are laid the two pearls next in size
which are the most nearly alike in form and hue; and so on to the end
of the necklace. This grouping requires both experience and judgment,
and is of great importance, since the value of the pearls is often
considerably enhanced by a proper arrangement. A skilful stringer
is able to grade them so cleverly that only a trifling difference will be
found in the weight of the two halves of a necklace.</p>

<p class='c013'>The stringing process consists in securing the end pearl by a knot to
the diamond, pearl, or other clasp which may be used. When a necklace
is being strung, the thread is passed through the metal eye, or
pearl, or other object that serves as a clasp. It is then tied with one
knot, passed through the next pearl, and knotted between that and the
second pearl, and sometimes between the second and the third, thus
making the joint doubly secure. The other pearls are then strung
in their order, a knot being placed after each fifth, fourth, third, or
second pearl, or, should there not be enough to give a proper length
to the necklace, between each single pearl. The deftness with which
the knot is tied so as not to hold the pearl too tightly, and risk the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>breaking of the thread, and the precision with which forty, fifty, and
even sometimes several hundred knots are made on a single string, is
a pleasing operation to witness, and requires the greatest care and
nicety of touch. If knots are made frequently between the pearls,
there is less danger of losing them should the thread break, as only
one or two can fall off; sometimes, indeed, when the drill holes are very
small, the silk thread, waxed or unwaxed, fits so closely that the pearl
does not become detached even when the thread breaks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The thread used is invariably of silk of the highest standard of
purity, strength, and texture, undyed, and not containing any chemicals.
Two or three of these threads are held together, then with a
knife the edges are very carefully scraped till the combined material
of the three threads is less than the thickness of one. Some use
a needle to scrape or fray to a sharp point. Then this point is stiffened
by means of “white glue,” the best material of this kind being pure
gum arabic dissolved in water. A little of this is rubbed on the
pointed threads. It stiffens in a moment, then the pearls are passed
on, one after the other. If the pearls to be strung are already
on a necklace, this process is simplified by the unknotting of the end
of the necklace to be re-strung; two or three of the pearls are slid on
to the new string, the ends or points of the new necklace thread are
twisted together with the old ends and the pearls are simply transferred.</p>

<p class='c013'>Frequently the holes have been drilled so as to leave the rims rather
sharp; in this way the thread may be frayed out or even cut. This
sharp edge can easily be removed by careful reaming. Silk of pure
quality is the best material known for stringing pearls. A series of
experiments were made with every available fiber of sufficient durability
from every quarter of the globe, but silk alone was found to
possess the strength, the flexibility, and the smoothness necessary to
permit a very fine set of threads to pass through an opening as small
as the drill hole of a pearl. In the case of a long chain or sautoire,
more than three hundred pearls will be strung on a single row, one of
over eighty inches in length containing over three hundred pearls, and
it requires a degree of neatness and patience that few possess to do
this in exactly the right way, so that the thread may not be cut, that
the pearls may not be too tightly strung, and that the ends shall be
carefully attached at the clasp, so that the necklace may hang well and
there may be no danger of the ends breaking loose.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to the frequency with which it is worn, a necklace should
be re-strung every three, six, or twelve months. The proper time for
re-stringing can generally be determined by the stretching of the
thread so that it can be seen either between the pearls or at either end,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>giving the impression that one or more pearls are missing. A newly
strung necklace is taut.</p>

<p class='c013'>Where a collar is from thirteen to fourteen inches in length, there
are frequently twenty-three rows of pearls, kept straight by four
jeweled bars, and sometimes from ten to twenty-five pearls in a section
between a bar. This would mean that there are more than two thousand
pearls in a collar of small pearls. When one considers that at
each bar and at the catch and clasp of the collar it is necessary to make
a knotting, it is not surprising that it requires from three to four days’
time of a very expert pearl stringer to string or re-string such a pearl
collar. A splendid example of such a twenty-three-row collar is that
belonging to Señora Diaz, wife of the President of the Republic of
Mexico.<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c017'><sup>[420]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Frequent stringing may sometimes serve as a protection for pearls,
as, if wax is used, the drill hole is likely to become coated with wax
from the thread, and this prevents the absorption by the pearl of perspiration
or moisture of any kind through the thread. Indeed, the
thread itself, when waxed, does not readily absorb moisture, and as
the interior of the pearl also becomes waxed, this serves to protect it
from the absorption of humidity of any kind.</p>

<p class='c013'>In making pearl necklets or muff-chains, a piece of gold wire of the
proper strength and pliability is taken. This wire is passed through
the hole of the pearl and then cleverly bent into a loop on each side and
firmly soldered. It is important that the wire should be very slightly
smaller than the dimension of the hole in the pearl so that it may fit
closely. Sometimes, instead of this method, a ring is soldered to one
end of the wire before this is passed through the pearl, the other end
being then secured in the manner described above. Still another
method is occasionally employed; in this a piece of the wire is bent into
a ring, but not quite closed, the aperture being just large enough to
admit the wire that has traversed the pearl; in this way the wire can
be introduced into the opening in the ring, which grips it tightly, and is
then soldered to it. In many cases two small rings are strung on the
wire on each side of the pearl before the loops are made, so that they
interpose between the latter and the pearl itself. This serves to protect
the sides of the pearl, as there is otherwise some danger that the hole
may become chipped or ragged; the same result can be obtained if
small caps, closely fitting the pearl, are used instead of the rings. This
is, however, only possible when the pearl is quite round, and in this
case the effect produced is often very attractive.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>Many of the pearls set as rings and studs are no longer set in points,
but are set upon a peg, or are “pegged,” as it is termed. Setting a
pearl in claws generally hides more than one half of the entire sphere.
But if the pearl is not properly secured upon the peg, it will occasionally
fall off. However, this can be obviated to a great extent by attaching
the pearl to a double peg which keeps it from turning and also prevents
its falling off. Pearls have occasionally been damaged with the shellac
used, or when the gold peg on which the pearl is placed was too hot.</p>

<p class='c013'>In mounting very small pearls as link chains so as to form a continuous
pearly rope without any break in the way of gold links, occasionally
V-shaped cavities are drilled into each end of the pearl, and
the setting itself is hidden in this V-shaped cavity. This is only done
where the pearls are small and not of great value.</p>

<p class='c013'>The jeweler, in setting pearls, must use the greatest possible care,
first, in cutting away the settings, as they are fastened to the pearl,
not to scratch or mar it; and then, when he files the settings, not to
allow the file to touch the pearl, as both the steel tool and the file would
injure it. He must particularly avoid placing the pearl too close to
a diamond, ruby, or other precious stone; for, even if the pearl only
slightly touches the gem against which it is set, a knock of the hand
may mar the pearl’s surface. More especially, as pearls are set at
present, “pegged” and without points, it is of the greatest importance
that they be worn in such a way that they may not touch the unexposed
edges of any precious stones, as this also would injure the pearls. For
lack of this precaution fine pearls have frequently been harmed.</p>

<p class='c013'>A large jewelry firm has under consideration the following pearl
order: Any workman who in any way mutilates a pearl by filing, imperfect
drilling or shaping, or in any way affects the shape of a pearl,
without the authority of the foreman, will be called upon to pay for
the same.</p>

<p class='c013'>As pearls are natural objects, any change of the same to fit the
setting, or for attachment to any gold object, mutilates the gem and
greatly affects its value. If belonging to a customer, this frequently
means its replacement, often at a great cost to the jeweler.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearl “blisters” frequently have the appearance of being empty;
they are generally filled with a fluid, either water or the product of
animal and vegetable decomposition. These contents usually emit
a peculiar and unpleasant odor. As the exterior of the inclosure
gradually wears away and disappears, the contents of the blister are
slowly absorbed by the shell itself, and any organic or insoluble substances
are deposited on its inner surface.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus, when a shell shows any protuberance on this surface, the
peeler will cut or scrape away a portion of the decaying shell behind
the spot. Should he discover the hole of a borer, he lays the shell aside;
but if he finds it to be perfect at this spot, it is evident that the inclusion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>came from within, and frequently it turns out to be an included pearl.
This is removed by breaking the shell, or by cutting around the protuberance
very near to its edge, and then breaking away the shell.
The pearl is often visible, and layer after layer of the covering mass
is removed with the greatest care by the peeler, who is rewarded by
bringing to light pearls of various qualities, and frequently those of
great value.</p>

<p class='c013'>An instance in which, by opening a pearl blister, the speculator received
a good reward is given by Streeter, who says: “The <i>Harriet</i> had
the good luck to find, in 1882, a pearl 103 grains in weight, which was
inclosed in a huge blister. It was a fine <i>bouton</i>, of splendid color in
the upper portion, but a trifle chalky below. This was attributed to
the admission of salt water into the shell through a hole made by a
borer which happened to pierce the shell just where the pearl lay, and
had penetrated the latter for almost a quarter of an inch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sometimes pearl masses are hollow. Barbot<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c017'><sup>[421]</sup></a> mentions that a
French merchant residing in Mexico, having bought one of these
pieces from a fisherman at a low price, resolved to satisfy his curiosity
by finding out what was inside. He split it in two parts and was
agreeably surprised to find a pearl weighing 14¼ carats (57 grains),
so round, of such good water, and such fine orient, that he sold it in
Paris for nearly 5000 francs ($1000) in 1850.</p>

<p class='c013'>Seed-pearl work was introduced into the United States, about
seventy years ago, by Henry Dubosq, who had studied the methods
employed in Europe and has been succeeded in this industry by his
son, Augustus Dubosq. The father bought a large quantity of English
seed-pearl jewelry, brought it to this country, and hired a number
of girls to take it apart carefully and re-string it with white horsehair,
to learn how it was made. With no more teaching, he established
an industry that has already lasted for three score and ten
years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Seed-pearl jewelry was most in vogue from the year 1840 to 1860.
It was generally sold in sets, in a case consisting of a collar, two bracelets,
two earrings, a small brooch, and a large spray or corsage ornament.
If the object was almost round, occasionally there was a larger
central pearl, weighing from one to five grains, usually a button pearl;
or, if the ornament was elongated, there were generally three larger
pearls. These sometimes possessed a fairly good luster. Seed-pearl
jewelry was at one time so popular, and the values were so small in
this country, that a $1000 seed-pearl set formed a principal feature of
the Tiffany exhibit at the International Exposition held at the Crystal
Palace, New York, in 1855.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>Seed-pearl tiaras sell for from $75 to $200 or $300 each. The work
is almost entirely done by girls, either German or of German origin.
As labor is higher and pearls have advanced in price, none of the old
work could now be duplicated for the amount it cost twenty or thirty
years ago. The stringing of the pearls on the English scroll means
probably twelve hours of continuous work. An efficient pearl worker
receives $3.50 a day, which consists of not more than eight hours, as,
owing to the very trying character of the work, clear daylight is
necessary to see the holes in the small pearls and in the mother-of-pearl
shell.</p>

<p class='c013'>The foundation of all seed-pearl work is mother-of-pearl. The shell
is brought in thin plates, measuring from one and one half to two and
one half inches square. One of the most popular and attractive patterns
is the English scroll. If a design is to be repeated, a brass
figure is made. For the fabrication of a brooch, for instance, a design
is first made by drawing on a paper or cardboard; then a brass plate
or pattern is cut out, leaving spaces wherever there are to be no pearls.
After this a slab of stock mother-of-pearl, nearest the size of the brass
plate, is selected, and is sawn out, using the brass plate as a guide for
the outlines. The mother-of-pearl is then pierced wherever a pearl is
to be secured, and the pearls for its embellishment are chosen, and are
strung onto the mother-of-pearl outlines with a special horsehair
thread. All the work that remains for the jeweler is the addition of
a pin or catch on the back. A representation is given of the designs,
the brass plate, the mother-of-pearl, the horsehair, the pearls, and the
completed brooch made by this model.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fine horsehair is used for stringing seed-pearls, because the holes
drilled in them are usually too small to admit of the use of silk, and it
is very important that what is known as pulled hair, taken from a
living horse, should be used, as otherwise the hair is too brittle. This
hair, in bunches of from eight to fourteen inches in length, is sold at an
average price of $1.50 a pound, and frequently only one ounce is
selected for use from the entire pound.</p>

<p class='c013'>All the pearls used by the seed-pearl workers are purchased in
strings and bunches; the finest are those known as the Chinese seed-pearls;
they are drilled and strung in bunches, weighing three ounces,
and are worth $40 an ounce. They are drilled with so fine an aperture
that silk will not pass through the pearl, and only horsehair can be
used. The Indian Madras pearls, however, have a larger drill hole
and can be strung with silk; they are at present worth from eight to
fifteen cents a grain, that is, $48 to $90 per ounce.</p>

<p class='c013'>Immense quantities of these very minute pearls are also used in
bunches or strings, sometimes as many as twenty or thirty strings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>being grouped together and either bound straight or else twisted into
veritable ropes of pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Seed-pearls are sold by the ounce, a single ounce frequently containing
as many as 9000,—that is, fifteen pearls to the pearl grain or sixty
to the carat,—selling for from $48 to $60 an ounce. Naturally, some
of these pearls are even smaller than this, but the average is maintained
by those that are a little larger.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls as small as 100 to a diamond carat are drilled and used
in seed-pearl work. Diamonds, rubies, and even sapphires, however,
are cut in brilliant form when they are as small as 250 to 300 to the
carat, or 45,000 to the ounce. The price of these small pearls, however,
is only from eight to fifteen cents per carat, whereas diamonds of this
size are worth from $200 to $300, their value being three times that
of those weighing one sixteenth to one eighth carat each. This is due
to the fact that the labor expended in cutting the smaller diamonds is
much greater than that bestowed upon the pearls, which simply require
drilling and not cutting.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Half-pearl,” as we have mentioned, is the name given to such pearls
as are round and spherically domed and are either somewhat flat or
almost the shape of one half of a whole pearl of the same diameter.
They are produced in two ways: some are cut away as hemispheres
from the inner surface of the shell of the pearl-mussel, but
more usually they are the better portions of defective whole pearls
which are sawn or split by hand into two “halves” with a minute saw,
the defective part being rejected altogether or classified as inferior
half-pearl, while the better half is classified as a I or II quality half-pearl.
Frequently a fine specimen is obtained from an elongated pearl,
and sometimes two, three, or even four half-pearls are secured from
the various bright parts of a round pearl. In splitting half-pearls, the
pearl to be operated upon is held by hand in a kind of grooved vice or
pincers and sawn through with a very fine saw; this process is at once
simple, rapid, and of insignificant cost.</p>

<p class='c013'>Only pearls which cannot be cut are filed. In this process the poorer
side of the pearl in question is laid upon the file, and the operator takes
a piece of ordinary hard wood, so formed that he can grasp it firmly
in his hand, presses it down upon the pearl, and rubs the latter on the
file, removing all but the good side. In this way a half-pearl is produced.</p>

<p class='c013'>The smaller half-pearls are from .5 to .75 millimeters in diameter,
and an ordinary ounce of half-pearl material will number 18,000. Of
the manufactured half-pearls there are, on an average, 20,528 to an
ounce.</p>

<p class='c013'>The half-pearl industry is largely carried on in Idar, on the Nahe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>River, and in Oberstein, in the Duchy of Oldenburg, Germany. The
pearls are usually purchased from London or Paris houses in lots
valued up to $12,000 or more, although some of the firms buy directly
from India. In Idar about one hundred people are employed in this
industry. Frequently it is pursued m the home of the manufacturer,
who may employ from one to a dozen or more workers. These generally
include a sorter or arranger, and a marker to indicate the part
of the pearl which should be sawn off. There is also a trimmer or one
who finally adjusts the pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>An unusually clever bit of deception was practised by an American
pearl fisher who had found two pearl blisters of almost identical size.
Both of these blisters were hollow, and were alike in form. The pearl
dealer very cleverly polished down both sides, rounded off the edges,
cemented the two backs together, and except for a tiny edge they had
all the appearance of a drop pearl that was fairly perfect on both sides.
It required but a little heating to separate the parts and show the deception.</p>

<p class='c013'>In setting half-pearls, they are generally selected from large lots
with great care as to their being of uniform size. A circular place for
the setting is often drilled with a steel drill, either for several or for a
single one. The half-pearl is frequently placed on one or more tiny
disks of paper, to give it the exact height in the setting, and the edge
of gold is rubbed up against the pearl, which is thus secured in its
place; or else tiny edges of gold are left projecting between each pearl.
These are pressed down after the pearl is in place. This process requires
great delicacy and skill and is frequently employed in the
decoration of pearl lockets and watches. In some of the cheaper
work, the half-pearls are cemented into the shallow disks that were
drilled for them, but frequently they are secured by metal points skilfully
raised out of the disks in which the pearls are set, and then
pressed down to hold the latter in place. Although apparently frailly
set, it is surprising that half-pearl ornaments have been owned for
more than a century, scarcely a pearl dropping out; and even if one or
two pearls should be lost from the piece of jewelry, the expense of
replacing them is not very great. They are often not as safely set
when they are mounted with diamonds, rubies, or other stones, more
especially in rounded rings or bracelets.</p>

<p class='c013'>In drilling gold for the setting of half-pearls, where the hole must
not be carried right through the metal, a so-called “pearl drill” is used.
This is designed to cut a hole with a flat base in comparatively thin
layers of metal without disfiguring the opposite side, a task that can
easily be accomplished if care be taken not to drill deeper than is
strictly necessary for the safe adjustment of the pearl. For the construction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>of this drill a piece of round steel wire of suitable size is
chosen; this is hammered flat at one end and then filed away at each
side, leaving a small spike standing in the center, which projects a
little beyond the cutting edges and acts as a pivot on which the drill
revolves. The steel on both sides of this spike is filed down to a fine
edge, care being taken to preserve the horizontal line, so that when the
spike is embedded in the metal both cutting edges come into play simultaneously.
If the drill is in good condition, it does its work very rapidly,
since it is used in an upright drill-stock, whose weight gives a
uniform and constant pressure. A good range of sizes of this drill
should be kept ready for use, so that one may be found to suit the dimensions
of any given pearl. This is essential in order to make an
opening just large enough to hold the gem, so that it may fit tightly,
without the necessity of reaming out the hole.</p>

<p class='c013'>Half-pearls were frequently used with the most pleasing effect in
the decoration of antique watches. A number of remarkable examples
of this type are among the collection of antique watches of Henry
Walters of Baltimore. This collection had been acquired by Tiffany &amp;
Co. after the sale of the San Donato Palace, the watches having been
withdrawn from the prince’s collection by his sister sometime before
the sale.</p>

<p class='c013'>In mounting pearls on gold, a white paste is sometimes employed in
half-pearl mounting, which is called by the French jewelers <i>gouache</i>.
This substance contains white lead, and its use is liable to be injurious
to the workmen, cases of lead colic having been recently recognized as
thus produced. This subject has lately (1907) been brought forward
at the Société Médicale des Hôpitaux in Paris. The cases were at first
mistaken for appendicitis, but proved to be well-marked cases of lead
poisoning. They had not been reported previously, and are evidently
not frequent, those noted being confined to instances in which the
employees had carelessly been in the habit of removing an excess of the
paste with the tongue.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearls that are constantly worn with judicious care do not seem
to deteriorate in any way. By judicious care we mean that pearls
should not be dropped or thrown down violently or placed on any
substance which is likely to act injuriously on the surface of the pearl
itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Strings of pearls should never be dipped into water or solutions of
any kind, because the string which passes through them is likely to absorb
and to draw the liquid into the pearl, and as the pearl is made up
of many concentric layers, it is quite possible that, through capillary
action, some liquid, either pure, or stained with a foreign substance,
might be brought into the pearl, which would in this way eventually
become discolored. Rings and brooches containing half-pearls frequently change color from this cause; but contact with the skin, or with
lace, or with fabrics which are not stained with certain chemical solutions,
seems to have no injurious effect upon pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>It is quite possible that in some instances where pearls which have
been inherited are thought to have changed and lost their beauty, this
belief has been owing to an exaggerated opinion of their quality on
the part of those who expected to inherit them and who never had the
opportunity to examine them carefully. In other words, in many cases
where pearls are believed to have lost their luster, to have died, or
partly died, there seems, from the personal observation of the writer, to
be little doubt that they never were really fine pearls, and that no
change had actually taken place in them. That pearls change but
slightly is evidenced by the fact that a splendid necklace belonging to
the Empress Eugenie, which was purchased about the year 1860, is in
as good condition to-day as when it first passed into the hands of
the unfortunate empress of the Second Empire. Many of the pearls
in the royal treasury in Vienna that belonged to Maria Theresa,
and those that were disposed of at the sale of the French crown
jewels in 1886, as well as the pearls that are in the imperial collection
at St. Petersburg, do not seem to show any appreciable evidence of
age.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearl is of a lower hardness than any of the precious or semiprecious
stones, and almost as soft as malachite, though not so friable
or liable to break as is that mineral; nevertheless, it is in many ways
one of the most indestructible of natural objects of the low hardness.
Still, pearls, and especially fine pearls, require some care; but, if the
same attention is accorded them as would be given to a fine piece of
lace, velvet, or other fabric, or to a fine jewel, they will last for a number
of generations. If, however, pearls are worn at all times without
removal, if they are worn in the bath, if they are thrown on a dressing-table,
dropped on the floor, or otherwise ill-treated, if they are worn on
dusty automobile rides, in bicycle riding, or during other gymnastic or
violent exercise, it is inevitable that their sides will rub together and
wear one another away. If they are worn in the bath or in swimming,
the silk string which holds them, should it become soaked, may draw
some of the water, accompanied perhaps with dust and perspiration,
through the drill hole into the center of the pearl, and this is likely to
be absorbed in turn by the various layers of the pearl, in some instances
undoubtedly affecting the color, changing it to a yellow or a gray. It
would be well not to wear pearls under the exceptional conditions
above mentioned; and, if they are carefully wiped at times, so as to
remove any perspiration or dust, their color is not likely to be affected
for a long period of time.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>Dr. George Harley writes in the “Proceedings of the Royal Society,”
March 1, 1888, p. 463:</p>

<p class='c020'>On one occasion being desirous to crush into powder a split-pea sized pearl,
we folded it between two plies of note-paper, turned up the corner of the
carpet, and placing it on the hard, bare floor, stood upon it with all our weight.
Yet, notwithstanding that we weigh over twelve stone, we failed to make any
impression whatever upon the pearl, and even stamping upon it with the heel
of our boot did not suffice so much as to fracture it. It was accordingly given
to the servant to break with a hammer, and on his return he informed us that
on attempting to break it with the hammer against the pantry table, all he
succeeded in doing was to make the pearl pierce through the paper and sink
into the wooden table, just as if it had been the top part of an iron nail, and
that it was not until he had given it a hard blow with the hammer against the
bottom of a flat-iron that he succeeded in breaking it.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the foregoing and other notes had appeared on this subject, the
author was led to observe that pearls are possessed of greater durability
than is generally supposed. In order to demonstrate this satisfactorily,
he took a number of American pearls and placed them upon
different kinds of woods, such as white and yellow pine, white oak,
teak, ash, cherry, chestnut, and rosewood. He then stood upon them,
thus bringing a weight of more than two hundred pounds to bear upon
them by means of his heel. The pearls were driven into the different
woods, with the single exception of the rosewood, which offered
greater resistance so that the pearl only entered partly. In but one
instance did a pearl suffer by a slight scaling off. This shows the
strength of the many concentric layers, both mineral and vegetable.</p>

<p class='c013'>This does not signify that pearls should be stepped upon, trodden
upon, or thrown about, as it is not unlikely that a pearl would crack if
it should fall from some height upon a hardwood or stone floor.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is believed by many that wrapping pearls in dyed velvets or in
fatty woolen materials, and locking them up in safe-deposit vaults, may
slightly change them. On the other hand, there is no doubt that sunlight
will bleach a pearl, and hence it is that wearing them in the
light and air cannot injuriously affect them.</p>

<p class='c013'>For cleaning pearls, first rub them with a cloth dipped in alcohol
diluted with warm (not hot) water, or in a weak solution of soap and
water, then dip another cloth in clean water and rub the pearls until
they are dry. Be careful not to leave them wet. Either salt, rice,
pearl-powder, or some exceedingly soft substance may aid in cleaning
them, but no abrasive such as ground pumice, electro-silicon, or any
powder that is sold as a polishing powder, should be used.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>There are many things that will cause injury to pearls. Occasionally
they are affected by the wearer having exudations from the skin induced
by some disease or else by acids which pass out through the
pores with the perspiration. A smoky atmosphere in which a sulphuric
acid is present owing to sulphur in the coal, violent usage such
as knocking severely, or dropping—all of these will in time cause more
or less injury to a pearl, more especially to one of the whiter varieties;
but it is believed that those of a yellowish cast are not so susceptible.
Diderot mentioned this as early as 1765.</p>

<p class='c013'>The “life” of a pearl is said to be fifty, one hundred, and perhaps
even one hundred and fifty years; they certainly last for several generations.
It has been asserted, without any particular authority, that
pearls from the Pacific Ocean and those from Mexico do not last as
long as those from the Orient, but this statement is questionable.</p>

<p class='c013'>If there be any foundation for the belief that it is not well to lock
pearls in a safe-deposit box, this is probably owing to the fact that the
absolute exclusion from the air may cause the drying out of the organic
constituent of the pearl. This may be obviated by putting the pearls
in a piece of linen absolutely free from any chemical, at the same time
placing with them a bit of blotting-paper or fiber-paper saturated with
water; the whole should then be wrapped up in paraffin paper, which
will prevent the evaporation of the moisture.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many sentimental recitals have appeared in the press during the last
ten years in regard to the dying of pearls. In connection with this
there is a beautiful though mythical story to the effect that Carlotta,
wife of the ill-fated Maximilian, Emperor of Mexico, was the possessor
of a large collection of pearls which had died, and that these pearls
had been placed in a casket and sunk in the depths of the Adriatic,
opposite the beautiful but unhappy palace home, Miramar, in the hope
that the salt water would revive and restore their original luster.
When, however, the time came to bring up the pearls from the sea, it
was found that the casket had, in some way, broken loose from the
chains, and all trace of it was lost. It is needless to state that there
was absolutely no foundation for this romantic tale; indeed, these
very pearls were afterward sold. Furthermore, pearls have never
lived, and hence they can never die. They do, however, decay, if
exposed to influences which destroy either the calcareous or the
animal layer of the pearl itself. This is due to many causes: first,
overheating, sometimes through the inexperience of a pearl driller;
secondly, undue exposure to heat in the washing of a pearl necklace;
thirdly, exposure to acids or acid fumes. Apparently there seems to
be some foundation for the belief that if they are confined in safe-deposit
boxes, probably in contact with wool or with the colored velvets
of jewel-cases, the skin of the pearl may be more or less affected. There is no question that in the oriental fisheries so-called
dead pearls have been found in the shell itself, probably owing to some
disease of the pearl-oyster; and they have also appeared in the fresh-water
pearl fisheries of the United States, where the pearls have been
too long boiled in the opening of the shell, or where they have been
swallowed and have passed through the body of some ruminant, such
as a hog, etc.</p>

<p>MADAME THIERS’S PEARL NECKLACE, BEQUEATHED TO THE LOUVRE MUSEUM, PARIS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>Probably about no necklace has more been printed than about the
famous necklace of Madame Thiers, now in the Louvre Museum of
Paris. Article after article has gone over the face of the earth, stating
that the pearls in this necklace were dying, and that a record was
being kept of the slow death that was overtaking them. Through the
courtesy of the director of the museum, M. Gaston Mogeaud, we are
permitted to reproduce the following statement from a letter, showing
very clearly that there is absolutely no truth in the assertion, and that
this necklace has in no way suffered, or is likely to suffer, for many
years to come.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The necklace of Madame Thiers has caused much ink to flow, to
such an extent that, a few months ago, the minister ordered an examination
to be made by three expert jewelers, who have found that
the pearls are in perfect condition, and have never been in better
health.”</p>

<p class='c013'>For assuring the safety of jewels there are the primitive methods
such as are used in the East Indies, of hiding pearls in out-of-the-way
places, where they often escape detection; or else they may be protected
by means of an armored room, like the gem-room that contained
the wonderful collection of the Duke of Brunswick when he
resided in Paris. Decoy necklaces have even been made to represent
the original, and so placed that they were taken away by the highwayman
or stolen by the burglar under the belief that he was stealing the
jewels; while in other cases the pearls have been carried in receptacles
that would not be taken for jewel-caskets, a device resorted to by some
travelers.</p>

<p class='c013'>A word in regard to the former system of strong boxes or small
safes for the home. These protect from fire and from the ordinary
thief, but they have sometimes not proved so invulnerable to the expert
cracksman. Quite recently a jewel chest has been devised which can
be placed in a trunk and carried from city to city by the owner. It is
provided with an exceedingly sensitive electrical apparatus, by means
of which a loud burglar alarm is set off should the chest be lifted even
one thirty-second of an inch or jarred ever so slightly. This alarm is
set automatically when the owner turns the key, and if once started, it
will ring for a couple of hours, stopping only when the box is unlocked,
thus preventing the carrying away of what is otherwise a portable box.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lastly, there are the more advanced methods, in use during the past
two centuries, such as taking the jewels to a banker and allowing him
to place them in his vault, where they are guarded as well as are his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>own belongings, but not always with the security of the modern safe-deposit
vaults, where the gems are absolutely under the control of the
owner, and can frequently be obtained at any hour of the day; or as
safely kept as they are when deposited in the safe deposit of the jeweler,
in whose establishment they can be cleaned, repaired, added to, or
changed without risking their removal to another building.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>The brilliant diamond and the love of its possession has captivated
many to such a degree that it has often been the cause
of intrigue and bloodshed; and national history has been influenced
by its acquisition or retention. The pearl, however,
though the most quiet of gems, has, in its own way, found favor in the
sight of emperors and empresses, kings and queens, generals, nobles,
and priests; and even savages have admired its quiet, stately dignity.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following pages are devoted to a description of the various
ornamental uses of the pearl in different times and countries. Naturally,
many of the famous pearls in the following chapter, if considered
purely as ornaments, might have found a place here.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Egyptians of olden times do not appear to have used fine
pearls, although they probably knew of them on account of the proximity
of the Red Sea. M. J. de Morgan, the explorer, says: “In the
tombs of Dashour I have never seen any; the only ones that I know of
in Egyptian jewelry belong to the Ptolemaic period and are mounted
in Greek style.”<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c017'><sup>[422]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>This statement is confirmed by Dr. William F. Petrie, the well-known
Egyptologist, who writes under date of July 26, 1907: “The
pearl was often used in Roman jewelry in Egypt, but I do not know
of any instance of it in pure Egyptian work. The Romans pierced
it and hung it by gold wire on earrings. They also made glass,
pearl-like beads, called <i>luli</i> by the modern natives. These beads are
made by silvering glass beads and then flashing over them another
coat of glass.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Among specimens of the late Egyptian work we may note here some
objects in the Louvre:</p>

<p class='c013'>A pleasing decoration on gold wire is a necklace in the collection of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>the Egyptian Gallery. In this very small pearls are used as a connective
decoration for the points of leaves, and to hold the leaves and
ornaments is a gold wire which is secured by bending. This piece
comprises 104 pearls, a greater number than is contained in any other
object of antiquity found in Egypt.</p>

<p class='c013'>An Egyptian pendant of unknown origin is also shown in this collection.
At the lower end is a bull’s head, caparisoned, and the tip of
each horn is fitted with a ball like the <i>embolados toros</i> of the Spanish
bull-fights. The rein is double, and above this there are two rondelles
of an unidentified material; then comes a rondelle of lapis lazuli, and
after this a rondelle of gold. The whole is strung with twisted gold
wire. The center stone is an hexagonal amethyst, evidently a crystal,
the two faces of which had been polished and incised. One of these
faces represents a priest with a staff of office, and the other a priest
holding an incense-burner with the hieroglyph of the altar. With one
hand he is offering the two sacrifices, the mineral and the vegetable;
in the other he holds a garland of flowers or leaves. Above this is
an Oriental pearl somewhat worn and abraded. All these are secured
by a twisted gold wire, to which four tiny gold beads of graduated size
are affixed at the top of the pendant.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are six other pendants and earrings in the Egyptian Gallery,
all of which contain pearls, and in most instances these pearls have
been drilled and suspended by metal wires, unless they are used as an
ornament facing outward. In four instances they are secured by a
peg of gold.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Assyrian and Persian bas-reliefs show that the sovereigns and
great personages of those countries adorned themselves profusely
with pearls. They wore them not only in their jewelry, but also on
their garments and even in their beards!<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c017'><sup>[423]</sup></a> The coins of the Persian
kings also bear testimony to the use of the gem in ancient Persia, since
the sovereigns are represented wearing tiaras ornamented with triple
rows of pearls.<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c017'><sup>[424]</sup></a> The same may be said of the imperial Roman diadem
from the time of Caracalla (188–217 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>).</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the most interesting of all ancient pearl necklaces,<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c017'><sup>[425]</sup></a> containing
more pearls than any other that has been found, and in a better
state of preservation, is the Susa necklace now in the Persian Gallery
of the Louvre Museum. It consists of three rows, each containing
72 pearls, so that there are 216 in all. Ten gold bars, formed of three
small disks, each about five millimeters in diameter, divide the necklace
into nine equal sections; at each end there is a disk, ten millimeters in diameter, to which the three strands are secured. If there
was any other setting, it has evidently disappeared, although it is
quite possible that there may only have been a string at each end, as in
the East Indian necklaces.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>This ornament was found on the site of the ancient Susa or Shushan
by M. J. de Morgan, February 10, 1901, in a bronze sarcophagus,
which contained the skeleton of a woman, adorned with a great number
of gold ornaments set and incrusted with precious stones. M. de
Morgan gives <i>circa</i> 350 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> as the probable date of these objects. The
pearls were much deteriorated. About 238 were found, but many of
them crumbled away when they were touched. M. de Morgan considers
that the necklace was of the type of the “dog-collar” of to-day,
and he believes that it originally comprised from 400 to 500 pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to a personal communication from M. P. Cavvadias, of
the Société Archéologique d’Athènes, there are no pearls on the ancient
ornaments preserved in the National Museum at Athens. This
is hardly surprising in view of the fact that the greater part of these
ornaments belong to the archaic period of Greek art; that is to say, to
a time when the pearl was evidently unknown to the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fact that we do not find more evidence of the use of pearls in
Greece at a later period need cause no surprise, when we consider
how many of the treasures of Greek art have disappeared in the course
of more than twenty centuries. There can be no question that they
were known and used as ornaments at an early time, as we can infer
from the description of them by Theophrastus and later Greek
authors.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Edward Robinson of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and
other authorities on Greek art and archæology, maintain that the
Arethusa necklace, and other ornaments of that time, depicted on
coins, etc., were meant to represent gold ornaments, as it is believed
by many that pearls were unknown in Greece at that period.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the most interesting specimens showing the use of a pearl
in ancient times is a very beautiful pearl pin from Paphos, on the
Island of Cyprus, which is mounted with a large marine pearl, probably
the largest antique pearl ever found, measuring fourteen millimeters
in diameter, and weighing about 70 grains. This, unfortunately,
has been very much abraded and worn away, although
more than half of the pearl is still present. It is surmounted by a
small fresh-water pearl, four millimeters in diameter, weighing about
two grains and in a much better state of preservation. This unusually
interesting example of prehistoric pearl is in the Greek and Roman department
of the British Museum, and we are able to show it by the
courtesy of the keeper of that department, Dr. Charles Hercules Read.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>In excavations made last spring (1907), in the Hauran district in
Syria, Azeez Khayat found a number of loose pearls which had
formed a necklace. The tomb in which they were discovered was cut
in the rock, and appeared to be of Roman origin. The pearls were
still attached to the old bronze wire with which they had been strung.
Mr. Khayat also mentions the finding of a pearl pin, and a single earring
bearing a pearl, in a rock-tomb at Cæsarea, in Syria. Rock-cut
tombs from ten to twelve feet in depth are frequently discovered, and
they probably date from the beginning of the Christian era.</p>

<p class='c013'>The habit was so common of using pearls as a base to throw up the
brilliance of other gems, that we may, perhaps, believe even in Caligula’s
slippers of pearls, with rubies and emeralds set upon them like
flowers.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Roman ladies had a special favor for pearls as earrings, and it
was one of their consuming ambitions to possess exceptionally fine
specimens for this purpose. They preferred pear-shaped pearls, and
often wore two or three of them strung together. They jingled gently
as they moved about—a fitting accompaniment, it may be said, to their
graceful movements—and from this jingling the name <i>crotalia</i>, or
“rattles,” was applied to them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The description given by Pliny of the pearl ornaments of Lollia
Paulina is the principal claim which the wife of Caligula has on our
interest.</p>

<p class='c020'>I myselfe have seen Lollia Paulina when she was dressed&nbsp;... so beset
and bedeckt all over with hemeraulds and pearles, disposed in rewes, ranks,
and courses one by another; round about the attire of her head, her cawle, her
borders, her perruke of hair, her bongrace and chaplet; at her ears pendant,
about her neck in a carcanet, upon her wrest in bracelets, &amp; on her fingers in
rings; that she glittered and shone againe like the sun as she went. The value
of these ornaments she esteemed and rated at forty million Sestertij<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c017'><sup>[426]</sup></a> and
offered openly to prove it out of hand by her bookes of accounts and reckonings.
Yet were not these jewels the gifts and presents of the prodigall prince
her husband, but the goods and ornaments from her owne house, fallen to her
by way of inheritance from her grandfather, which he had gotten together
even by the robbing and spoiling of whole provinces. See what the issue and
end was of those extortions and outrageous exactions of his: this was it. That
M. Lollius, slandered and defamed for receiving bribes and presents of the
kings in the East; and being out of favor with C. Cæsar, sonne of Augustus,
and having lost his amitie, dranke a cup of poison, and prevented his judiciall
triall: that forsooth his neece Lollia, all to be hanged with jewels of 400 hundred
thousand Sestertij, should be seene glittering, and looked at of every
man by candle-light all a supper time.<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c017'><sup>[427]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>And the taste of the Roman ladies for pearls has perpetuated itself
in Italy, though other of the luxurious habits which in their case accompanied
it, have long since died out. The women of Florence even
now are not content if they do not possess a necklet of pearls, and this
generally forms the marriage portion of the middle-class women.
It is thought, just as it was in ancient Rome, that this gives an air of
respectability, and forms a sure protection from insult in the street or
elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the earliest illustrations showing a pearl earring is the one
in the ear of Julia, the daughter of Titus, incised on a splendid aquamarine
in the Bibliothèque Nationale. This gem was formerly in the
Treasury of St. Denis, and is considered to belong to the Carlovingian
period.<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c017'><sup>[428]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>So large and heavy were the earrings worn in Rome that there were
women known as <i>auriculæ ornatrices</i>, special doctresses whose sole
occupation was the healing of ear tumors and of injured or infected
ears. In a similar way, at the present day, we have the ear piercer,
whose vocation, however, is rapidly becoming useless because of the
ingenious modern devices for holding the pearls to unpierced ears;
and we must consider this eminently desirable when we think of the
ear-piercing outfits of the former jeweler, who never disinfected his
apparatus, and when we recall the fact that it was always expected
that the ear would swell, first, from the crude awl that was used,
and, secondly, from the unsterilized instruments.</p>

<p class='c013'>That the Romans believed in decorating the statues of their goddesses
with pearls and dedicating them as offerings, is evidenced by
the gift of Cleopatra’s pearl, which was cut in halves to make earrings
for the Venus of the Pantheon; and by the buckler of British
pearls for the statue of Venus Genetrix, given by Julius Cæsar.
Quite a number of statues and busts of the Roman period, and some
of an earlier time, have the ears pierced for the reception of earrings,
and it is highly probable that pearls were used for this decoration.
Among these are the busts of Pallas and Juno Lanuvina in the Vatican;
that of Eirene, a marble copy of a work of Cephisdotus, in the
Glyptothek, Munich, and the Venus de Medici in the Uffizi, Florence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pottier<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c017'><sup>[429]</sup></a> mentions several other Greek statues which show that earrings
were used for their adornment; as, for example, the winged Victory
of Archernos, in Delos; the head of one of the caryatids found at
Delphi, a cast of which is in the Louvre; the archaic Aphrodite of the
Villa Ludovisi; the Athena from the frieze of the temple at Ægina;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>the Venus of Milo, etc. In other instances the ornament was simply painted
on the ear as is shown in the Aphrodite in white marble which
has been found in Marseilles. This may also have been the case in the
frieze at Olympia. The earrings used in these statues were usually
metal disks entirely covering the lobe of the ear. We have, however,
many representations of pearl earrings in the paintings at Pompeii,
and on cameos and coins. These show us several of the types mentioned
by Pliny and other authors; still, they are smaller and more unpretentious
than we might expect in view of the well-known luxury of
the Roman ladies in this respect. The greater part of the earrings
represented show a pearl suspended from a single wire; there are
some, however, with three pearls, one above the other,<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c017'><sup>[430]</sup></a> and a few
bearing several pearls loosely hung together, answering to the description
of the <i>crotalia</i>. Others, again, bear pear-shaped pearls or
<i>elenchi</i>.<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c017'><sup>[431]</sup></a> It is a singular fact that scarcely any of the busts of Roman
women are ornamented with earrings, but it is quite possible that the
cause for this must be sought in the desire of the artist to dispense
with unimportant details which might detract from the general effect
he wished to produce. We may note, however, four female figures in
the Gallerie des Empereurs in the Louvre Museum, with the ears
pierced for the reception of earrings (Nos. 1195, 1202, 1230, and
1269).</p>

<p>Pearl earrings from Herculaneum and Pompeii</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Many numismatists, among them Dr. F. Louis Comparette,<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c017'><sup>[432]</sup></a> believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>that the necklaces and earrings represented on Greek coins from the
fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> are intended to represent pearl ornaments, since the
personages depicted are in all cases female divinities, goddesses, or
nymphs, held in great veneration in the city where the coins were
minted, and it is almost certain that the artist intended to portray the
choicest and most beautiful of gems as an adornment for the beautiful
head of the city’s patron.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Syracusan coins, by Euvenetus, minted in the early part of the
fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and bearing the head of Arethusa, seem to be the
earliest coins showing a neck and ear ornament. This was later imitated
on the Greek and Greco-Roman coins. A coin of Sulla shows a
double necklace, one strand consisting of round beads and the other
of pendants. The later coins almost always represent the goddesses
with neck and ear ornaments. Some of the latter, however, resembling
amphoræ, are neither round nor pear-shaped.</p>

<p class='c013'>In view of the great fondness of the Romans for pearls, it is not surprising
that many of these gems have been found in the excavations at
Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Capodimonte. The collection of earrings
preserved in the Naples Museum is especially noteworthy. Here we
can see earrings consisting of a simple golden hoop, from which hangs
a wire bearing a single pearl; others in which a cross-bar is attached
to the hoop, and at each end of this bar is a loosely hung wire with a
pearl at its extremity, this earring suggesting the <i>crotalia</i> mentioned by
Pliny (see Fig. A); and still others wherein the pearls are strung directly
on the hoop. The cross-bars are of various designs, sometimes
entirely smooth, and again shaped like a cornice or a pediment; in other
cases we have an earring with two pearls on a wire, then a pierced
transparent stone, and beneath that, two pearls terminating the large
drop. A few of the earrings are more elaborate, as, for example,
one represented in Fig. B which was found in Pompeii, March 8,
1870. Here there is an emerald in the center, surrounded by gold rays,
between which were set eight pearls, two of which are now missing;
above is a small pearl. The single earring shown in Fig. D came from
Herculaneum, and bears a circlet of thirteen pearls, alternating with
rubies and other stones; beneath there is a link from which depends a
pearl about seven and a fifth millimeters in diameter, and weighing
nearly twelve grains. The fact that we know the latest date to which
these pearls can be assigned, namely, 79 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, renders them peculiarly
interesting and valuable from a historical point of view. Naturally,
many of them are calcined or otherwise damaged, but others are fairly
well preserved as to form, although the luster has departed from them.
There are twenty-seven earrings in the collection, and the pearls number
about one hundred. No great pearls were found.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>In the Roman excavations, and in those of other early remains,
many objects are found in which there may be a sapphire, an emerald,
or several other stones, pierced, and pendant on a gold wire, with a
blank space between, showing that something was there originally.
This object has apparently decomposed and fallen away. We may
reasonably suppose that it was either a pearl or a glass bead, and it is
unlikely that glass would be used in connection with the more precious
materials. This pearl or glass may have been affected by the organic
acids or the acids resulting from the decomposition of the body with
which the ornament was buried for a score of centuries.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the ancient jewels containing pearls which are preserved in
the Hermitage at St. Petersburg, we may mention a broken gold
ring with a roughly cut turquoise and two pendants, each set with two
pearls separated by a garnet. This object was found in southern Siberia
during the reign of Peter the Great, and may belong to the second
century before Christ. Also may be noted a pair of gold earrings,
with an engraved six-rayed star, in the center of which a pearl is
set, while below hang three pendant sticks, two of which have a pearl
at the extremity. These earrings were found in 1892 in a tomb situated
close to the site of the ancient town of Chersonesus, in the Crimea.
As a coin of the Emperor Gordianus III (224–244 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) was discovered
in the same tomb, we may assign the earrings to the first half of
the third century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span></p>

<p class='c013'>Beside another pair of earrings, one of which is set with a pearl, and
two pearl-headed pins, all from the neighborhood of Tiflis, in the
Crimea, we may especially refer to an earring made of a plain, thick,
golden wire, on which seven pearls are threaded; one of these occupies
the center and the others are grouped around it. This earring was
purchased in 1903 by the Russian Imperial Archæological Commission
from a collector residing at Odessa; it is said to have been found on
the site of the ancient Greek colony of Olbia, but we have no definite
external or internal evidence to sustain this view.</p>

<p class='c013'>We may also note the gold necklace and earrings<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c017'><sup>[433]</sup></a> containing pearls
found near the site of Olbia during the reign of Napoleon III, and now
in the collection of the Roman, Campana. These objects are especially
interesting owing to the fact that the pearls are drilled and a gold cap
is set on each side.</p>

<p class='c013'>A pair of pearl earrings were found in a tomb on Mount Mithridates,
near Kertch, in the Crimea. These earrings probably belong to
the third or fourth century of our era. Of the four pearls which originally
adorned the cross-bars, only one has been preserved. Another
pair of earrings was discovered in the same place. It is probable that
they were ornamented with pearls in a similar way, but the latter have
entirely disappeared.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>Gabriele Bremond states in his “Viaggi di Egitto,” <i>Lib.</i> I, c. 30,
that it was a Mohammedan custom to embroider baldachins and carpets
of precious metals with pearls. This use is especially typified in a
baldachin of gold embroidered with pearls which is over the sepulcher
of Mohammed at Mecca.<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c017'><sup>[434]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>When the Mohammedans captured the Persian city Ctesiphon, in
637, they collected an immense booty. Each of the 60,000 soldiers
received the value of 12,000 dirhems ($1560), a total of $93,600,000.
Among the treasures sent to Caliph Omar (581–644), in Medina, was
a crown, perhaps that of Khusrau I (499–579), which Tabari says
was studded with 1000 pearls each as large as a bird’s egg.<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c017'><sup>[435]</sup></a> There
was also a wonderful carpet 450 feet long and 90 broad, with a border
of emeralds, rubies, sapphires, and pearls, representing luxuriant
foliage and beautiful flowers. Tabari states that it was called the
“Winter Carpet,” because “the Persian kings used it in winter when
there was no longer verdure or flowers, for whoever was seated on
this carpet thought he looked out upon a garden or a green field.”<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c017'><sup>[436]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>On the occasion of the marriage of the Caliph Al-Mamun (786–833)
with the daughter of Hassan Sahal, all the grandees of Al-Mamun
received slaves of both sexes as presents from the bride’s
father. The preliminary negotiations were held at Fomal Saleh, and
the road traversed by the bride and bridegroom to reach Bagdad, a
distance of one hundred miles, was covered with mats of cloth of gold
and silver. We are told that the bride wore on her head-dress a thousand
pearls, each of which is said to have been of enormous value.<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c017'><sup>[437]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Describing the birthday festival of Kublai Khan (<i>circa</i> 1275 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>),
Marco Polo says: “The Great Kaan dresses in the best of his robes,
all wrought with beaten gold; and full 12,000 Barons and Knights on
that day came forth dressed in robes of the same colour, and precisely
like those of the Great Kaan, except that they are not so costly; but
still they are all of the same colour as his, and are also of silk and gold.
Every man so clothed has a girdle of gold; and this as well as the dress
is given him by the Sovereign. And I will aver that there are some of
these suits decked with so many pearls and precious stones that a single
suit shall be worth full 10,000 golden bezants [about $25,000].”<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c017'><sup>[438]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In the Kan period, in China, the dead bodies of the emperors were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>embalmed and wrapped in a garment ornamented with pearls. They
were then inclosed in a case of jade.<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c017'><sup>[439]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Speaking of the jewels of the King of Maabar, or what is now
known as the Coromandel Coast, Marco Polo tells us: “It is a fact
that the king goes as bare as the rest, only round his loins he has a
piece of fine cloth and round his neck he has a necklace entirely of
precious stones,—rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and the like, insomuch
that this collar is of great value. He wears also hanging in front of
his chest from the neck downwards, a fine silk thread strung with 104
large pearls and rubies of great price. The reason why he wears this
cord with the 104 great pearls is (according to what they tell) that
every day, morning and evening, he has to say 104 prayers to his idols.
Such is their religion and custom; and thus did all the kings his ancestors
before him, and they bequeathed the string of pearls to him
that he should do the like.”<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c017'><sup>[440]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A favorite East Indian amulet is known as the “Nao-ratna” or
“Nao-ratan,” and consists of “nine gems”: in former times the pearl,
ruby, topaz, diamond, emerald, lapis lazuli, coral, sapphire, and a stone,
not identified, called the gomeda. At the present time these stones are
generally the coral, topaz, sapphire, ruby, flat diamond, cut diamond,
emerald, hyacinth, and carbuncle. This talisman may suggest the
Urim and Thummin or sacred oracle of the Jews, which was said to
have been taken from Jerusalem in 615 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> by Khusrau II, the Sassanian
Persian king.</p>

<p class='c013'>The East Indian custom for persons of quality was to wear a pearl
between two colored stones in each ear, that is, either between two
rubies or two emeralds; and Tavernier noted, about 1670, that there
was no person of any consideration in those regions who did not wear,
in each ear, a pearl set between two colored stones. Another favorite
ornament for women in India is a girdle elegantly embroidered, bearing
a large pendant pearl in front, where it is fastened.<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c017'><sup>[441]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A necklace of twenty-seven pearls bears in India the name of <i>nakshatra
mālā, nakshatras</i> (originally “stars”) being the name of the
twenty-seven divisions of the Hindu zodiac.<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c017'><sup>[442]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In the Indian jewels often a small spot of enamel is fastened or
melted on to a gold wire, and then one or several pearls are hung upon
it; or beads of some gems, as sapphire, ruby, emerald, or even glass,
may be added or alternated with pearls. Then the enamel stop-piece is
turned down and the other end of the gold wire is twisted on to the
setting, loosely, in such a manner as to swing freely. It is the effect
of these dozens or even hundreds of swinging drops that add such
grace and elegance to East Indian jewelry.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>In China, such precious stones as the ruby, sapphire—both blue and
yellow—the emerald, and the pink tourmaline, are not facetted, as with
us, but are generally polished in conformity to the shape of the bead
or other ornament, and never have a lathe-turned or cut appearance;
they are either set in cabochon or as beads, rounded, oval, or elongated.
All these forms, and the colors used by the Chinese, lend themselves
well to combinations with pearls; and hence pearls are often found in
Chinese jewelry, especially in those ornaments which are flexible and
graceful, in which the pearls and gems are strung on wire and allowed
to swing freely with a gentle tinkle when the wearer moves. This is
not unlike the setting of such gems in ancient Roman times. An admirable
example is shown and described in Bushell’s “Chinese Art”
(Vol. II, plate 108, page 90). In this head-dress of a Manchu lady,
there are combined with the pearls, jadeite, amethyst, amber, and
coral, on a gilt silver openwork, with blue kingfisher feathers. This
great cap of state is an admirable example of pure Chinese design and
workmanship. The pendant strings of pearls are occasionally relieved
by a bit of carved jade, carnelian or coral, especially the latter. Another
example, the “cap of state” has silver-gilt openwork and immortelles
(Taoist symbols), and is much enhanced in beauty by a decoration or
inlay of plates of the beautiful blue feathers of the kingfisher, which
are used so extensively and effectively in Chinese jewelry. The pearls
are scattered at intervals over the cap, and ten strings of them hang
from the sides of it. This is believed to be of Manchu origin by Dr.
Stephen W. Bushell, the great Chinese scholar, to whom we are indebted
for the use of the illustration. We are also told that young
ladies in China wear a sort of crown constructed of pasteboard, covered
with silk. This is adorned with pearls, diamonds, and other jewels.<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c017'><sup>[443]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The pearls on many Chinese ornaments were generally strung upon
silk, often with half a dozen or a dozen seed-pearls above and below
the large pearl, to hold the latter in place, and also to add a softness to
the whole jewel. The end pendant pearl, even if pear-shaped, was
usually pierced entirely through, and a wire that was worked through
it was flattened out, and this gold head was again ornamented in some
way. A Chinese pendant from the China-Japan war-loot offers an
excellent illustration of this kind of pearl-setting. This was preserved
in a double box of finely carved gold.</p>

<p class='c013'>The rosaries containing 104 pearls, which are used to-day, were
mentioned centuries ago by Marco Polo, and an excellent pearl string
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>of this kind has been in the Russian Treasury at Moscow for over two
hundred years. Dr. Stewart Culin, the archæologist, who has paid
much attention to Chinese customs, informs us that the black and
white counters made for use in games by the Chinese are called black
and white pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. T. Nishikawa writes us in 1908 that pearls were used in Japan
for ornamental purposes more than a thousand years ago. Large
abalone pearls are found in images of Buddha made in 300 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> Fresh-water
pearls, usually from Dipsas and Unio, were also used. A
beautiful color-print was made by Hoku’ai of the first pearl, called
“tide-jewel” by the Japanese.</p>

<p class='c013'>Most interesting pearls are those in a brooch in the British Museum,
which was discovered in 1839 while excavating a sewer opposite Ludgate
Hill in Thames Street, at the depth of about nine feet, in a dark-colored
artificial stratum of earth, unaccompanied by any remains that
could aid in throwing light upon its history. It is four inches and a
half in circumference, and is composed of a circular compartment an
inch and a quarter in diameter, set with variegated enamel, representing
a full-faced head and bust, with a crown on the head, and the
drapery of a mantle, formed of threads of gold effectively arranged
so as to mark the features of the face and the folds of the drapery;
this is inclosed in a border of rich gold filigree work, set at equal distances
with four pearls.<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c017'><sup>[444]</sup></a> Dr. Charles Roach Smith attributes this
brooch to the time of King Alfred, and supposes it to have been executed
in England by a foreign artist. He only ventures a conjecture
that the head might be that of King Alfred.</p>

<p class='c013'>Crowns, both ancient and modern, are richly ornamented with
pearls. We shall treat of the crown of the Holy Roman Empire and
of the imperial Austrian crown in the following chapter. One of the
most interesting and ancient is the famous crown of Khusrau II
(reigned 590–638), made in the latter part of the sixth century, which
was brought to light by Shah Abbas after a thousand years of concealment
in an obscure fortress among the mountains of Lauristan.
It does not contain diamonds among its ornaments, but is incrusted
with pearls and rubies.<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c017'><sup>[445]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>From the representation given on the cup of Khusrau, the throne of
the Sassanian Persian kings appears to have been as large as a couch;
it was supported by four winged animals, whose model had been borrowed
by the Sassanians from their ancestors, and it was covered with
an embroidered stuff thrown over mattresses and cushions. If we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>may believe Tabari (“Chronicles,” trans. by Zotenberg, Vol. II, p.
304), this throne was of gold, enriched with precious stones, and surmounted
by a crown of gold and pearls, so heavy that the sovereign
could not wear it, and therefore had it suspended above his head.<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c017'><sup>[446]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>One of the crowns in the Hermitage at St. Petersburg was discovered
in 1864 in a tumulus near Novo-Tcherkask, with many other
valuable objects, all of which had apparently been buried with some
important personage. This crown resembles somewhat that of Reccesvinthus
in the treasure of Guerrazar, although some portions of it
seem to belong to the period of the Roman empire. The conjecture
has been made that the crown may have been worn by a queen since it
is decorated with a finely executed bust of a woman in amethyst. The
crown itself is of pure gold, and was bordered with two rows of pearls,
which have disappeared, leaving only the small disks to which they
were attached; besides these, it was ornamented with a number of
uncut precious stones. The date of this object cannot be exactly determined,
although the consensus of opinion is that it belongs to about
the third century after Christ. Possibly the bust and some other
portions, which appear to be of Greco-Roman workmanship, are of
this period, while the rest of the crown was executed one or two centuries
later; it is about seven inches in diameter and two in height.<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c017'><sup>[447]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Toward the end of the year 1858 a French officer who lived in Spain,
while making some excavations on a property he owned there, discovered
fourteen small gold crowns. They were taken to the Spanish
mint and are said to have been melted for bullion. New excavations
on the same spot brought to light eight other crowns of considerable
weight, of the finest workmanship, and incrusted with precious stones,
pearls, etc. There is no doubt that these crowns were buried in the
early years of the eighth century, when the Arabs, led by Tarik, invaded
Spain and forced the Gothic dynasty to take refuge in the north
of Europe. The importance of this discovery is very great, since it
gives us positive evidence of the development of the goldsmith’s art in
Spain at that early period. An inscription proves that one of the
crowns was dedicated in the second half of the seventh century, and it
is one of the few authentic memorials we possess of that epoch. In
February, 1859, the eight crowns were purchased by the French government
and placed in the Musée de Cluny. Two other crowns found
in the same place were added in 1860, and complete the collection.</p>

<p class='c013'>The largest of these crowns is that of the Gothic king, Reccesvinthus,
who was King of Spain from 649 to 672. It is composed of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>wide band of solid gold, ten centimeters wide and twenty-one centimeters
in diameter (about four and eight inches respectively). This
band, which opens by means of a hinge, is surrounded by two borders
of gold set with the red stones of Caria, called “gemmae alabandenses,”
and the band itself is studded with thirty large oriental sapphires
of the greatest beauty. Thirty fine pearls of appropriate size
alternate with the sapphires on a ground incrusted with the red stones
above mentioned. From twenty-three small gold chains depend large
letters in cloisonné, and also incrusted, forming the sentence: RECCESVINTHUS
REX OFFERET. Each letter has a gold pendant
with a pearl from which hangs a pear-shaped sapphire.</p>

<p class='c013'>The crown is suspended from four chains, converging to a double
floral ornament of solid gold, adorned with twelve sapphire pendants.
This ornament, the leaves of which are open, is surmounted by a
capital of rock crystal, then comes a ball of the same material, and the
whole is terminated by the gold center to which the four chains are
attached.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cross, which is suspended underneath the crown by a gold chain,
is remarkable for its elegance and its richness. It is of solid gold and
is inlaid with six very fine sapphires and eight large pearls, each of
which is mounted in relief with claws. At the back, the cross still bears
the wire by which it was attached to the royal mantle. The inside of
the crown is quite smooth; the outside is composed of elegant fleurettes
in openwork, the leaves being filled with the same species of red
carnelian mentioned above. There are thirty sapphires, all of the
finest water, and a few of them show the natural facetted crystallization;
the two principal ones, placed in the center of the band, are thirty
millimeters in diameter. The pearls are of an exceptional size, and
only a few of them have been injured by time. The total number on
the crown, cross, and top ornament, is seventy, thirty of which are
unusually large. The chains are each composed of five openwork
ornaments with an enamel paste inlaid in the gold edge. A close
examination of the crown shows that it had been worn before the king
presented it to some church.</p>

<p class='c013'>The royal Hungarian crown given to St. Stephen by the pope in the
year 1000 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, when Hungary became an empire, is one of the most
ancient crowns in existence. It contains 320 pearls and was procured
in Byzantium. It was pledged to the emperor, Frederick IV, by Queen
Elizabeth of Hungary, probably about 1440.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>In the cathedral of Prague (the metropolitan church of St. Vitus)
there may be seen the crown which was made by the order of Charles
IV (1378) out of four pounds, ten and a quarter ounces of gold. It is
adorned with twenty-nine pearls, forty-seven rubies, twenty sapphires,
and twenty-five emeralds. The value of the gold and gems was
estimated at $10,000 in 1898, which is probably less than it would
be worth to-day. The sacred crown worn by St. Wenceslaus was
inserted within the crown of Charles IV at the instance of Queen
Blanca. The golden scepter and the golden orb are of very beautiful
workmanship. The scepter has six rubies, eight sapphires, and
thirty-one pearls. There may also be seen in the treasury a gilded
monstrance, in the style of the Renaissance, studded with pearls and
precious stones, a gift of the princely family of Schwarzenberg. Within
the same cathedral, in the tabernacle of the chapel of St. Ludmilla,
wife of the first Duke of Bohemia, is the head of that saint, bearing a
crown studded with 1800 pearls.<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c017'><sup>[448]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The crown of Vladimir, with its singular and thoroughly Russian
form, is preserved in the treasury of the Kremlin at Moscow, and has
been used at the coronation of all the Russian emperors. It has borne
the name of the crown or cap of Monomachus from the reign of
Ivan IV. Although, to judge from this designation, the crown was
probably executed in the twelfth or thirteenth century, there is a legend
to the effect that it was sent, in 988, from Byzantium by the ruler as a
gift to St. Vladimir. It is executed in filigree work, and is surmounted
by a plain cross with four pearls at the extremities; between these
pearls are set a topaz, a sapphire, and a ruby. The crown itself is
ornamented with four emeralds, four rubies, and twenty-five pearls
from Ormus, set in gold. The cap has a bordering of sable fur, and
is lined with red satin. (See Maskell, “Russian Art,” London, 1884,
p. 125.)</p>

<p class='c013'>The imperial state crown of her Majesty Queen Victoria, was made
in the year 1838 by Messrs. Rondell and Bridge, with jewels taken
from old crowns, and others furnished by command of her Majesty.
It consisted of diamonds, pearls, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds, set in
silver and gold. It had a crimson velvet cap with ermine border, and
was lined with white silk. Its gross weight was thirty-nine ounces five
pennyweights troy. The lower part of the band above the ermine
border consisted of a row of 129 pearls, and the upper part of a row
of 112 pearls; between these rows, in the front of the crown, was a
large sapphire (partly drilled) purchased for the crown by his
Majesty George IV. In the front of the crown, and in the center of a
diamond Maltese cross, was the famous ruby said to have been given to
Edward, Prince of Wales (the Black Prince), by Don Pedro, King of
Castile, after the battle of Nájera, near Vittoria, 1367 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> This ruby
was worn in the helmet of Henry V at the battle of Agincourt, 1415
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> It was pierced quite through, after the eastern custom, the upper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>part of the piercing being filled up by a small ruby. From the Maltese
cross issued four imperial arches composed of oak leaves and acorns,
thirty-two pearls forming the acorns. From the upper part of the
arches were suspended four large pendant, pear-shaped pearls with
rose diamond cups.<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c017'><sup>[449]</sup></a> Writing in 1850, Barbot, the French jeweler,
placed the value of this crown at $600,000.</p>

<p class='c013'>The crown of St. Edward, the official crown of England, is used at
each coronation.<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c017'><sup>[450]</sup></a> The original crown of this name was destroyed by
the republicans in 1649, but at the time of the coronation of Charles
II, another crown was made to take its place, under the direction of
Sir Robert Viner. As far as can be known, this crown was an exact
copy of the older one, which was worn by Edward the Confessor, and
perhaps even by King Alfred. The crown in use at present is of gold,
richly studded with pearls and precious stones of various kinds: diamonds,
rubies, emeralds, and sapphires. There is a mound of gold on
top, and on this a cross of gold ornamented with very large oval pearls,
one attached to the top and the two others pendant from the ends of
the cross. The present arrangement of the jewels cannot date back
earlier than 1689, as the crown was found to be despoiled of them at
the time of the accession of William and Mary. Those now in the
crown are acknowledged to be inferior to the former ones.</p>

<p class='c013'>The orb or mound which is placed in the king’s hand immediately
after his coronation, is a ball of gold, six inches in diameter, surrounded
by a band of the same metal ornamented with roses of diamonds
set around other precious stones, and bordered with pearls. It is
surmounted by a cross, embellished with four larger pearls at the angles
near its center, and three others at the ends. The orb, including the
cross, is eleven inches high, and it is figured on the coins of many of the
English kings, who are represented holding it in their left hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>The regalia of Scotland,<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c017'><sup>[451]</sup></a> consisting of the crown, scepter, and
sword of state, are preserved in the castle of Edinburgh. It is not
certainly known at what time this crown was executed. At the coronation
of Robert Bruce (1274–1329) a simple circlet of gold was
used; this fell into the hands of the English after the battle of Methven
in 1306. In 1307 Edward I issued a pardon at the request of his “beloved
Queen Margarate,” to a certain Galfredus de Coigniers, who
was said to have concealed and kept “a certain coronet of gold with
which Robert the Bruce, enemy and rebel of the King, had caused
himself to be crowned in our own Kingdom of Scotland.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>Sir Walter Scott, in his account of the regalia, gives it as his
opinion that the present crown was probably made for Robert Bruce
at a later date, and that it was used at the coronation of his son, David
II  (1324–1376). The style of workmanship indicates a fourteenth-century
origin. The crown was originally open and was arched over
by James V (1512–1542). As Scott notes, this was done to many royal
crowns in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, in order to assimilate
them to the type of the old imperial crowns.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following description is slightly abridged from that given by
Sir Walter Scott:</p>

<p class='c020'>The lower part consists of two circles, the undermost much broader than
that which rises over it; both are of the purest gold and the uppermost is surmounted
by a range of <i>fleur-de-lis</i> interchanged with crosses <i>fleurées</i>, and
with knobs or pinnacles of gold topped with large pearls; this produces a
very rich effect. The under and broader circle is adorned with twenty-two
precious stones, betwixt each of which is interposed an oriental pearl. The
stones are topazes, amethysts, emeralds, rubies and jacinths; they are not polished
by the lapidary, or cut into facets in the more modern fashion, but are
set plain, in the ancient style of jewellers’ work. The smaller circle is adorned
with small diamonds and sapphires alternately. These two circles, thus ornamented,
seem to have formed the original Diadem or Crown of Scotland, until
the reign of James V, who added two imperial arches rising from the circle,
and crossing each other, closing at the top in a mound of gold, which again is
surmounted by a large cross <i>patée</i> ornamented with pearls and bearing the
characters J.R.V. These additional arches are attached to the original crown
by tacks of gold, and there is some inferiority in the quality of the metal.</p>

<p class='c020'>The bonnet or tiara worn under the crown was anciently of purple, but is
now of crimson velvet, turned up with ermine—a change first adopted in the
year 1695. The tiara is adorned with four superb pearls set in gold, and fastened
in the velvet which appears between the arches. The crown measures
about nine inches in diameter, twenty-seven in circumference, and about six
and a half in height from the bottom of the lower circle to the top of the cross.</p>

<p class='c013'>The scepter, made by order of James V at the time he added the
arches to the crown, is a slender silver rod about thirty-nine inches
long. An antique capital of embossed leaves supports three small
figures representing the Virgin Mary, St. Andrew, and St. James,
above which is a crystal ball, surmounted by an oriental pearl.</p>

<p class='c013'>The regalia have passed through many vicissitudes. After the
execution of Charles I, his son Charles II was crowned King of Scotland
at Scone on January 1, 1651. On the advance of the parliamentary
army into Scotland, the regalia were placed in the care of the Earl
Mareschal who preserved them in his castle of Dunrottar, and here
they were kept until the castle was besieged and on the point of falling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>into the hands of the English. In this extremity, they were rescued
by Christian Fletcher, wife of the Rev. James Granger, minister of
Kinneff. She obtained permission from the English general to pay a
visit to the Lady Mareschal and succeeded in carrying off the regalia.
Her husband buried them in the church of Kinneff, just in front of
the pulpit. When they were brought to light again after the Restoration,
an Act of Parliament was passed which, after reciting Christian
Fletcher’s services in the matter, stated: “Therefore, the King’s Majestie,
with advice of his estates in Parliament, doe appoint Two Thousand
Merks Scots to be forthwith paid unto her by his Majestie’s
thresaurer, out of the readiest of his Majestie’s rents, as a testimony
of their sense of her service.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1707, after the union of England and Scotland, it was considered
wiser to remove the regalia from public view, since they were calculated
to arouse memories of the old Scotch monarchy. These precious
objects were therefore inclosed in a chest, which was their usual receptacle,
and locked up in the crown-room, a strong vaulted apartment
in Edinburgh Castle. There the regalia remained until 1817, when, as
doubts had been expressed as to their existence, a commission of investigation
was appointed, one of the members being Sir Walter Scott.
The chest—which had probably been the jewel-safe of the Stuarts—was
forced open, and the regalia were found within, just as they had
been deposited in 1707.</p>

<p class='c013'>An imperial German crown does not exist; a design has been made
and accepted, but at the present date, 1907, it has not yet been executed.
On festive occasions, when the imperial insignia are necessary,
the Prussian insignia are used, especially the Prussian royal
crown. This consists of a circlet of gold set with thirteen diamonds.
On this are five leaves, each composed of three larger diamonds and a
smaller one, and four prongs, each bearing a diamond and above it a
large pearl. From the five leaves start the same number of semicircular
arches, tapering toward the central point, where they unite.
Each of these is set with ten diamonds of decreasing size. On the center
rests an imperial globe. It consists of a large Indian-cut sapphire,—the
counterpart of the one on the Austrian imperial crown, evidently
dating from the time of the Crusades,—and above it rises a chaplet
ornamented with diamonds. The crown has a lining of purple velvet
reaching to the arches. Between the arches are eight pearl pendants
of an average weight of 80 grains; they are 25 millimeters in length,
and have a fine, brilliant white color, although they are not perfectly
regular in form.</p>

<p class='c013'>In addition there belongs to the regalia a pearl necklace of three
rows; the first consists of thirty-seven pearls averaging 28 grains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>each; the second of thirty-nine pearls averaging 34 grains, and the
third of forty-five pearls averaging 39 grains. There is also a guard
chain of 114 pearls, averaging 20 grains, making a total of 2280
grains for the chain. These pearls are also of irregular form.<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c017'><sup>[452]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The crown jewels of the Sultan Abdul-Aziz (1830–1876) were of
immense richness and value. At the exhibition in Vienna, 1873, many
of these were exhibited in a building created specially for the purposes
of display and protection. They were in five compartments, in what
might be termed five impregnable fire-proof safes of a peculiar construction.
Among other interesting objects was the armor of Sultan
Murad I (1319–1389), the founder of the Ottoman empire in Europe.
This armor is of the most delicate oriental workmanship. Diamonds,
pearls, and rubies are worked broadcast over it with exquisite
taste.<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c017'><sup>[453]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In Germany and Austro-Hungary there are many valuable ecclesiastical
ornaments, some of which possess great interest for the history
of early German art. They also serve to show the appreciation of
the pearl even in the Dark Ages and the Early Renaissance period.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the most curious productions of early German art is a reliquary
in the form of a sack, which is from Enger near Herford, and is
exhibited in the Kunstgewerbe Museum in Berlin. It is set with
cameos and pearls; several of the latter have dropped out; a few, however,
remain in their setting. According to a very probable tradition,
this reliquary was given by Charlemagne to the Saxon duke, Wittekind,
on the occasion of his baptism in 785. It is of very rude and
primitive workmanship and, if we accept the tradition, it is not unlikely
that it was executed at Aix-la-Chapelle.<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c017'><sup>[454]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>An interesting example of German art, from the time of Archbishop
Egbert of Treves (977–993), is a frame now in the Beuth-Schinkel
Museum, at Charlottenburg. This was probably the framework of a
portable altar. It is decorated with a simple geometrical design in the
three primary colors, and has four polished stones and four pearls on
the outer border of gold filigree. Another example of the art of
Treves at the time of Archbishop Egbert is the Echternacher Codex.
The gold-plated cover is a worthy product of the school: ivory, enamel,
and mosaic are combined in its decoration with rows of pearls.
Among the representations of many saints, appears the figure of the
Empress Theophanu, daughter of the Greek emperor, Romanos II,
with the inscription “Theophaniu imp.” Opposite is a youthful figure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>probably that of her son, Otho III. It seems likely that the work
was executed, at the command of the empress, between 983 and
991.<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c017'><sup>[455]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In the cathedral of Treves is the portable altar known as the altar of
St. Andrew. This was primarily a reliquary and secondarily an altar.
In memory of the relic of the sandal of St. Andrew, which was greatly
prized by Archbishop Egbert, this altar bears the representation of a
foot executed in wood and covered with plates of gold. The front of
the case is divided into three fields; that in the middle containing a
Byzantine lion in gold relief, and the others the symbols of the four
evangelists in enamel work. The border is formed of rectangular
pieces of enamel and smaller ones of gold, and it is set with round
stones alternating with half-pearls; the ends are covered with filigree
and enamel work wherein are embedded strings of pearls. A coin of
Justinian II is set in the middle of the back of the case and is surrounded
by a wreath of larger pearls.<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c017'><sup>[456]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A gold cross, the work of Rogkerus Theophilus, is in the Kunstgewerbe
Museum in Berlin, and comes from Herford. The frame, which
is of wood, is covered with plates of gold; at the extremities and in the
center are groups of precious stones surrounded by pearls; at the base
is a fine Augustan cameo with a wreath of pearls; the entire cross is
covered with filigree work and decorated with pearls in groups of
threes. The arrangement of the precious stones, and the enhancement
of their beauty by means of the circles of pearls, are highly artistic.
As a work of Rogkerus, this cross must have been executed at the very
end of the eleventh century and it may be regarded as one of the finest
examples of the art of this period.<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c017'><sup>[457]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A very rich collection of ecclesiastical ornaments is contained in the
treasury of the cathedral of Gran in Hungary.<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c017'><sup>[458]</sup></a> One of the most interesting
objects is a reliquary in the form of a Latin cross, which is
of great historical and artistic value. An inventory made after 1528
describes it briefly: “crux aurea continens lignum vitae” (a gold cross
containing the wood of life). Although this reliquary probably belongs
to the end of the twelfth century, the inventory of 1659 describes
it as a gift of King Stephen, and proceeds to say that the kings of
Hungary took their coronation oath upon it. This custom has been
preserved to the present day, and Emperor Francis Joseph, on the occasion
of his coronation as King of Hungary, June 8, 1867, swore,
upon this cross, to uphold the constitution and the laws of the land.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>The cross is decorated with plates of gold in filigree design, and has
four en cabochon cut sapphires and eighteen oriental pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>The greatest treasure of the collection is known as the cross of Corvinus,
King of Hungary, and is decorated with a great number of
pearls.<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c017'><sup>[459]</sup></a> It is a remarkable example of early Italian Renaissance art.
The entire structure is about twenty-eight inches high; the pedestal is
triangular and ornamented with pearls and precious stones; three
sphinxes bearing shields with the arms of Corvinus support a disk
from which springs a triangular support sloping outward; on the three
sides are mythological figures. Upon this base rests the chapel, a light
Gothic structure with the figure of the Saviour bound to a pillar in the
center, and the busts of three prophets in the niches outside. Above all
is the crucifix, on each side of which are figures of the Blessed Virgin
and of St. John. Around the base and about each division of this
elaborate design is a row of pearls; the Gothic chapel is surmounted
by a close-set row, and each of its six pinnacles terminates in an oval
pearl. The cross itself has fifteen large pearls disposed in twos and
threes, and many smaller ones. There are at least two hundred pearls
on the whole structure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another cross, with the arms of the primate, George Szolepchényi,
and bearing the date 1667, is of pure design and richly decorated with
pearls and precious stones.<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c017'><sup>[460]</sup></a> It is quite possible that this cross, which
seems to belong to a better period, was bought by the archbishop, who
afterward added his arms. There are thirteen oriental pearls, three
at the top, three at the end of each of the arms, and four at the intersection.
This cross was used as an “instrumentum pacis,” for the kiss
of peace, on solemn occasions such as coronations.</p>

<p class='c013'>We may also note the pendant with the image of the Virgin Mary as
patroness of Hungary, which is of gold enamel and has two pendant
pearls and a sapphire, and likewise the pectoral cross of the primate,
Emerich Losy; this is of gold, decorated with green, blue, and black
enamel, and has three pendant pear-shaped pearls, one quite large, as
well as thirty-four smaller round pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the many valuable and interesting objects in the treasury
of the house and chapel of Maria Loretto am Hradschin,<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c017'><sup>[461]</sup></a> at Prague,
there is a monstrance of silver-gilt, thirty-seven and a half inches high
and fifteen and three quarter inches wide. It dates from the beginning
of the eighteenth century, and is not a harmonious whole, but
only a combination of different ornaments of precious stones, corals,
and several hundred pearls of various sizes. All these are the devotional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>offerings of now unknown givers, and many of the pieces are of
artistic workmanship. This monstrance owes its origin to Josef von
Bilin, who was a monk of the Capuchin order and a sacristan of Maria
Loretto. On account of the many pearls which adorn it, it is known
by the name of the “Pearl Monstrance.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Another monstrance of Arabic gold, of the year 1680, is twenty
inches high and is studded with fifty-one pearls, of which twenty-nine
surround the disk, while the remainder are on the plate and the base.
There are also two crowns of silver-gilt for the statues of the Virgin
and of the Infant Jesus. The larger of these crowns has eighteen
diamonds, a ruby, and 102 pearls set in two rows; while the smaller has
nineteen diamonds and a great number of pearls; both crowns are made
up of the offerings of the faithful.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a historic description of the pearls in the treasury of the Kremlin,
Margeret, a Burgundian captain (“Estat de l’empire de Russie,”
1649), says that the treasury was “full of all kinds of jewels, principally
pearls, for they are worn in Russia more than in the rest of
Europe. I have seen fifty changes of raiment for the emperors around
each of which there were jewels for a bordering, and the robes were
entirely bordered with pearls, some with a border of pearls measuring
a foot, half a foot, or four inches in width. I have seen dozens of bed-coverings
embroidered with pearls.”<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c017'><sup>[462]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In the treasury of the celebrated Troiza Monastery near Moscow,
there is an immense collection of ornamental objects for ecclesiastical
use, the value of which has been estimated at many millions of rubles.
Here may be seen miters and bishops’ crooks—many of them of solid
gold and set with precious stones—Bibles and missals in golden bindings,
priestly vestments, altar-cloths, etc., all literally covered with
pearls. There is also a dish filled with large pearls of enormous value.<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c017'><sup>[463]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The use of fresh-water pearls in one of the most interesting ecclesiastical
objects of antiquity is shown in the “Shrine of St. Patrick’s
Gospels,” which is in the Dublin Museum. It was purchased by the
Irish Royal Academy in 1845 for £300 ($1500). This shrine, known
as the “domnach airgid,” is of Irish manufacture and was perhaps
made in the eleventh or twelfth century. It was found in the neighborhood
of Clones, in County Monaghan, and is ornamented with three
bosses which contained uncut crystals, and are decorated with figures
of grotesque animals and traceries enameled in blue paste; between
these may be seen representations of four horsemen. On each of the
four corners there was a fresh-water pearl, one of which still remains
in its setting. According to George Petrie, LL.D., in his “Christian
Inscriptions in the Irish Language,” the shrine bears an inscription to
the effect that it was made by John O’Barrdan at the instance of John
O’Carbry, Abbot of Clones, who died in 1353.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>Dr. R. F. Scharff informs us that there is also in the Dublin Museum
a modern Celtic gold brooch, presented to Queen Victoria on the occasion
of her visit to Ireland in 1849, and containing a pearl of beautiful
luster, discovered in Lough Esk, which is in the western part of Ireland.
Dr. Scharff says that this pearl is undoubtedly from the <i>Margaritifera
margaritifera</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. W. Forbes Howie of Dublin writes that the shrine of O’Donnel,
made in 1084, originally contained pearls. It still retains some pieces
of amber and coral. Mr. Howie believes that fresh-water pearls were
freely used in the decoration of ancient Irish shrines.</p>

<p class='c013'>The inventories of jewels and ornaments belonging to the kings and
queens of France, to the nobility, and to the treasures of the Sainte-Chapelle,
in Paris, and of the abbey and church of St. Denis, all mention
a large number of objects decorated with pearls.<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c017'><sup>[464]</sup></a> The more important
of these are given below.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following ornaments decorated with pearls are mentioned in
the inventory of Louis, Duke of Anjou, which was made <i>circa</i> 1360:<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c017'><sup>[465]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c020'>A large silver-gilt foot for a vase or chalice, resting upon six lions couchant,
and set with groups of four pearls with a garnet in the middle.</p>

<p class='c020'>A half girdle of gold with a hinge bearing two ornaments, one a balas set between
two eagles. Between the ornaments is a gold bar set with eight pearls
in two rows. In front is a clasp with a large sapphire in the middle, surrounded
by two balases and two sapphires alternating with pearls.</p>

<p class='c020'>A gold brooch having a balas-ruby in the middle, and at each side four
sapphires and four clusters each of five quite large pearls.</p>

<p class='c020'>A gold brooch of a very pretty design, with five balas-rubies, two sapphires,
and eight very round pearls weighing about four carats each. At each end of
the brooch is a flat pearl weighing about five carats.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is in the Bibliothèque Nationale<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c017'><sup>[466]</sup></a> in Paris, the original record
of the execution of the testament of the Comte de Montpensier, son of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>the Duc de Berri. This document was written in 1398, and it mentions
that the sale of the jewels and plate of the count produced the
sum of “2390 livres tournois 11 sols 3 deniers [about $8265].” In the
record we have a description of “a large gold cup, weighing 5 marcs,
7 ounces, 1 gros [nearly 3 lbs.], whereon there is a crown of precious
stones.” The decoration of the cup comprised thirty large pearls, six
balas-rubies, and four sapphires, and we are told that the Duc de
Berri retained it for his own use.</p>

<p class='c013'>An early mention of the use of pearls in rings occurs in the inventory
of the Duc de Berri,<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c017'><sup>[467]</sup></a> to whom we have just referred. This inventory,
which was made in 1416, notes a gold ring with black enamel,
set with a pearl called “the great pearl of Berri.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The inventory of the personal property of Marguerite, Countess of
Flanders, the mother of the Duke of Burgundy, was made in 1405.<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c017'><sup>[468]</sup></a>
In this inventory we have a list of an immense number of ornamental
objects of every sort and kind, and everything, from the ducal crown to
the smallest trinket, is garnished with pearls. In most cases the number
of pearls is given, and we find that no less than 4494 are enumerated.
Evidently the duchess was ever ready to honor the precious
gem to which she owed her name, and fully recognized its poetical significance.
The following are a few of the more noteworthy ornaments
in the inventory:</p>

<p class='c020'>The circlet of the great crown, composed of eight sections; four of which
each comprise sixteen pearls, four diamonds, and four balas-rubies, with a
sapphire in the center; the four others contain sixteen pearls, four diamonds,
and four sapphires, with a balas-ruby in the center; beside this there are two
pearls in each section. Also, eight large fleurons of the great crown, four of
which bear each twenty-three pearls, five diamonds, three balas-rubies and a
sapphire, and the other four each twenty-three pearls, five diamonds, four
sapphires, and a balas-ruby; and eight small fleurons of the said crown garnished
each with a pearl, a sapphire, and a balas-ruby. The whole is valued at
8724 florins ($22,682).</p>

<p class='c020'>A gold cap with ten large ornaments fashioned like brooches, five of which
are each of six pearls and a balas-ruby, and the other five each of five pearls
and two balas-rubies, and between each ornament there is a balas-ruby. This
is appraised at 2159 florins ($5613).</p>

<p class='c020'>A head-dress garnished with balas-rubies and sapphires and tassels of large
pearls, each of six pearls, and with a row of larger balas-rubies, larger sapphires
and larger pearls. This was estimated at 2030 florins ($5278).</p>

<p class='c020'>A gold necklace, enameled white and green, garnished with nine rubies, thirteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>diamonds and thirteen pearls, with a clasp of three small rubies, and three
large pearls with one large diamond in the center. The worth of this necklace
is given as 1923 florins ($5000).</p>

<p class='c020'>The jewels and ornamental objects in this inventory are appraised at the
sum of 56,129 florins,—about $145,000,—equivalent to a much larger sum
to-day in consideration of the greater purchasing power of money in the fifteenth
century.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1480, during the reign of Louis XI, an inventory was made of the
objects preserved in the treasury of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris.<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c017'><sup>[469]</sup></a> We
select the following items from this inventory:</p>

<p class='c020'>A very beautiful cross, covered with gold, bearing on one side a crystal
reliquary which contained a piece of the True Cross. On supports attached to
the cross were images of the Virgin Mary and of St. John, each holding a
reliquary. The cross itself rested on a square silver-gilt base bearing the
images of the four evangelists. The ornamentation consisted of fifty large
Scotch pearls and 142 small ones, intermixed with garnets and emeralds;
there were also many balas-rubies and sapphires of different sizes. The inventory
says: “The goldsmith Nicholas Roet declares that the stones are
genuine and that the pearls are from Scotland.”</p>

<p class='c020'>Another gold cross, resting on a silver-gilt base which bore the arms of
France and Burgundy, was decorated with fourteen sapphires, twenty balas-rubies,
and twenty-four Scotch pearls. On the base were the figures of St.
Louis and of the queen, kneeling in prayer.</p>

<p class='c020'>Still another cross, covered with gold and of Venetian workmanship, bore
thirty-nine pearls, twenty-seven balas-rubies, and four sapphires. A clasp attached
to this cross was set with four large perforated pearls surrounded by
small emeralds and sapphires.</p>

<p class='c020'>A silver-gilt ornament, consisting of a golden image of St. Louis seated
on a silver throne and holding in his hand a reliquary decorated with twelve
pearls, six emeralds, and six Alexandrian rubies. The crown of the image
was set with four large oriental pearls, three balas-rubies, etc.</p>

<p class='c020'>An ivory image of the Virgin Mary, supported by a silver-gilt base with the
arms of France. This base was borne by four lions. On the head of the
Virgin was a crown of gold adorned with eight large, round, oriental pearls
and four small ones, as well as four emeralds and four balas-rubies. On the
breast of the image was a very large, square emerald.</p>

<p class='c020'>A splendid miter studded with good-sized pearls and decorated with emeralds,
rubies, sapphires, and balas-rubies. The pendants were covered with
seed-pearls and precious stones.</p>

<p class='c020'>A fine chasuble of Indian satin lined with crimson taffeta and covered with
lilies, birds, unicorns, etc., embroidered in gold and pearls. It was also
adorned with small clusters of pearls and with two shields bearing the arms of
France and Navarre, quartered.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>A beautiful copy of the gospels with covers of gold, ornamented with fourteen
large sapphires, thirteen balas-rubies, two cameos, and eighty-nine good-sized
pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following items are taken from the inventory of the treasury of
the abbey of St. Denis, made in 1534, during the reign of Francis I.
This record is in the Bibliothèque Nationale, in Paris:<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c017'><sup>[470]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c020'>A crown of gold, with four fleurons, garnished with several balas-rubies,
emeralds, sapphires, and pearls; valued at 59,980 crowns (about $135,000).</p>

<p class='c020'>A golden cross and within it a piece of the True Cross which belonged to
“Jeanne d’Evreux, royne de France et de Navarre,” valued, with the pearls
that decorate it, at 345 crowns ($776).</p>

<p class='c020'>A wooden chest containing eleven cases in which were many precious stones
and large and small pearls, both oriental and Scotch; valued at 1858 crowns
($4180).</p>

<p class='c020'>A number of priestly vestments embroidered with seed-pearls are inventoried
at 1200 crowns ($2700).</p>

<p class='c020'>A blue satin chasuble bordered with pearls is valued at 350 crowns ($787).</p>

<p class='c020'>An altar-table, set in the “grand altar,” is described as elaborately decorated
with “arches and pillars and images of gold” in low relief, and garnished with
precious stones and pearls. The value is given as 1203 crowns ($2700).</p>

<p class='c020'>Another altar-table similarly ornamented is valued at 2645 crowns ($5850).
Above this table was a great cross of gold with a silver border, called the
“cross of St. Eloysius” (the patron saint of goldsmiths); this was valued at
2291 crowns ($5154).</p>

<p class='c020'>Over the sarcophagus containing the body of St. Denis, there was “a large
tabernacle of wood-work resembling a church, with a lofty nave and low
arches.” In this nave and in the transepts there were three representations of
sarcophagi; the whole was covered with gold, precious stones, and pearls, and
was valued at 7275 crowns ($16,368).</p>

<p class='c020'>The head of St. Denis, incased in gold, was borne by two silver-gilt angels,
while a third held a small shrine containing a portion of the jaw-bone of the
saint. All these objects were studded with precious stones and pearls, and
were valued at 5622 crowns ($12,650).</p>

<p class='c020'>There were also in the treasury several miters covered with “ounce-pearls”
and decorated with gold and silver bands; on this field several larger pearls
were set. One of these miters is valued at 964 crowns ($2169) and another at
509 crowns ($1135).</p>

<p class='c020'>The total value of the articles inventoried is 185,500 crowns (at least
$417,375).</p>

<p class='c013'>Inventories of the property of the dukes of Lorraine, dated 1544,
1552, and 1614, mention a number of pearl ornaments. In the inventory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>of 1544, made about the time of the accession of Francis I of
Lorraine, we read of “a very fine case of silver-gilt around which are
thirteen personages in gold, and on the lock three balases and five
pearls.” The inventory of 1552, made while Charles II was duke,
mentions “a cap of crimson velvet whereon there are large pearls,” and
another cap “entirely covered with pearls.” It is, however, in the inventory
of 1614, made a few years after the accession of Henry II of
Lorraine, that we find the greatest number of items relating to pearls.
An estimate of the value of the rings and jewels was “faicte du commandement
de son Altèze par jouailliers et Lapidaires et Espertz dudit
ars.” All these jewels were to remain forever the property of the
Duchy of Lorraine. Among the items relating to pearls, the following
are worthy of note:</p>

<p class='c020'>A gold collar with seven settings, each containing one large diamond and
two large pearls. The diamond in the center was believed to weigh fifteen
carats, and the collar was valued at 35,000 crowns (about $70,000).</p>

<p class='c020'>Another collar contained seven diamonds and sixteen pearls set in pairs,
and was considered to be worth 19,750 crowns (about $40,000).</p>

<p class='c020'>A collection of one hundred large pearls, some weighing twenty grains, some
twenty-four, some twenty-eight, and a few thirty-two grains, were estimated
at 12,000 crowns ($24,000).</p>

<p class='c020'>A large pearl, very nearly pear-shaped and almost as large as a pigeon’s egg,
was set down at 2000 crowns ($4000).</p>

<p class='c020'>A very fine pear-shaped pearl weighing forty-eight grains was valued at 800
crowns ($1600).</p>

<p class='c020'>Another pear-shaped pearl weighing about thirty-two grains was placed at
500 crowns ($1000).</p>

<p class='c020'>Four other pear-shaped pearls, nearly as large as the one above mentioned,
were estimated at 300 crowns ($600), while a round “pearl of Seville” was
valued at only fifty crowns ($100).</p>

<p class='c020'>Six clusters of pearls, each containing two of fourteen grains, and four of
eight grains, were thought to be worth 700 crowns ($1400).</p>

<p class='c020'>A large chalice was decorated with seven large oriental emeralds and eight
clusters, each composed of fourteen fine, round pearls, six of twelve grains
and eight of eight grains; the whole valued at 2400 crowns ($4800).</p>

<p class='c020'>A hat ornament composed of eleven fine rubies and ten large, round pearls,
each weighing twelve grains, was estimated at 800 crowns ($1600).</p>

<p class='c020'>A similar ornament, composed of thirteen rubies and fourteen pearls,
partly flat and partly round, was placed at 2000 crowns ($4000).</p>

<p class='c020'>A collar set with seven fine rubies and the same number of round pearls,
each weighing twelve grains, and with seven other pendant pearls, was valued
at 550 crowns ($1100).</p>

<p class='c020'>There was also a bed called the “bed of pearls,” which was elaborately decorated
with ornamentation in gold and richly studded with pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>The inventory made in 1634 of the ornaments, etc., contained in the
abbey of St. Denis, offers some new material and a fuller description of
a few of the objects mentioned in the inventory of 1534. The most
noteworthy entries are given below:</p>

<p class='c020'>A golden scepter upon a staff of wood. The scepter bears the figure of
Charlemagne seated upon a throne; at the corners are two lions and two eagles
(one of the latter was lacking in 1634). The figure holds a scepter in its right
hand, and a globe surmounted by a cross in its left; on its head is a crown
with a large, round, oriental pearl valued at 200 livres ($135). The throne
rested on a fleur-de-lys, beneath which was a ball of gold ornamented with
eight oriental pearls. Around the throne was the inscription: “Sanctus Carolus
Magnus Italia Roma Gallia Germania,” and three clusters of three pearls each.
The value of this scepter was given at 3300 livres, or about $2200.</p>

<p class='c020'>The reliquary of the hand of St. Thomas. Two angels, resting on a silver-gilt
base, bore the crystal receptacle containing the relic. The ornamentation
consisted of eight clusters of four large pearls each, with a small diamond in
the center. On the hand was a gold band bearing the inscription: “Hic est
manus beati Thomae apti. quam misit in latus domini nostri Jesu Christi.”
On the hand was a pontifical ring set with a large sapphire. The reliquary
also bore the images of St. John the Baptist, of St. Thomas, and of the Virgin
Mary. It was valued at 5590 livres, or about $3700.</p>

<p class='c020'>A vessel made of a porphyry resembling jasper and embellished with forty-six
pearls; estimated at 1500 livres ($1000).</p>

<p class='c020'>A cope given by Anne of Bretagne, Queen of France, and bearing six scenes
from the life of the Virgin Mary embroidered in gold and pearls; the whole
bordered with pearls and gold of Cyprus. On the cope were the letters A and
S, and the words “plutost mourir.” There were two ounces of pearls. Valued
at 2000 livres ($1350).</p>

<p class='c020'>A vase of rock crystal, of antique workmanship, with a cover and base of
silver-gilt; the top decorated with a band of amethysts, garnets, and sapphires,
alternating with Scotch and oriental pearls. On the base are various precious
stones and twenty-three Scotch and oriental pearls, and the inscription “Hoc
vas sponsa dedit Anor. regi Ludovico.” This vase was given by Eleanor of
Aquitaine to her husband, Louis VII of France (1137–1180), by whom it was
bestowed upon Suger, Abbot of St. Denis (1082–1152). The goldsmith work
and decoration belong to the time of Suger. The vase is now in the Louvre.</p>

<p class='c020'>A chalice of agate, with two handles, and engraved with the figures of men,
animals, and birds. It stood on a foot of gold adorned with sixteen sapphires,
forty-four pearls, and twenty-two clusters of fourteen pearls each.
This chalice rested upon a paten of porphyry decorated with seven fishes inlaid
in gold, and with a bordering of pearls and precious stones disposed
around the edge. Both together valued at 25,000 livres (about $16,000).</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>A vase of agate with a foot of silver-gilt, and furnished with a cover and a
spout in the form of a serpent, both of silver-gilt. Around the base an inscription:
“Dum libare deo gemmis debemus et auro, Hoc ego Sugerus offero
vas domino” (Since we should pour libations to God out of gems and gold, I,
Suger, offer this vessel to the Lord). This vase, which is now in the Louvre
and is of sardonyx, was enriched with many precious stones and with nineteen
Scotch and oriental pearls. The value given was 1500 livres (about $1000).</p>

<p class='c020'>A book beginning: “Kyrie Eleison,” with covers of wood, one overlaid with
gold and the other with silver. On the golden cover was an ivory crucifix, and
images, in ivory, of the Virgin Mary and of St. John. The cross was bordered
with seed-pearls, as were the diadems of the images. The cover was also
decorated with an engraved crysolite, an engraved peridot, and with sapphires,
emeralds, and garnets.<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c017'><sup>[471]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A curious item regarding the use of pearls in embroidery is contained
in one of the inventories of the dukes of Burgundy, made in
1414; this reads as follows:</p>

<p class='c020'>The sum of 276 livres 7 sols 6 deniers tournois (about $960), the price of
960 pearls destined to ornament a dress; along the sleeves are embroidered the
words of the song “Madame, je suis joyeulx,” and the notes are also marked
along the sleeves. On each sleeve are 264 pearls which help in forming the
notes of the said song, numbering 142; that is to say, a square made of four
pearls for each note.<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c017'><sup>[472]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Mention is made in two old French documents of the use of pearls
from Compiegne in ornamentation. In the “Inventaire de la royne
Clémence,” in 1328, we read of “a cock covered with precious stones
and bearing a pearl of Compiègne”; and in the “Comptes Royaux,”
under date of 1353, appears this item: “For four pearls, oriental,
Scotch and of Compiègne, for the said arm-chair, 48 crowns.” As
these pearls could not have been found in Compiègne, we may suppose
that there was a market for their sale in that place, which gave
rise to the designation.<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c017'><sup>[473]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The English authority and writer on early English silver, F. Alfred
Jones, communicated, under date of September, 1907, that pearls were
rarely used in old English plate; in fact, any such embellishments
were of exceedingly infrequent occurrence. They are, however,
frequently mentioned in the inventory of the marvelous collection of
gold plate dispersed by Charles I of England, which may have dated
from the time of the looting of the churches and monasteries by
Henry VIII.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following items are from the inventories of Philip II of Spain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>and of Margarita, wife of Philip III. The original documents are in
the Austrian archives.</p>

<p class='c020'>A golden cup which came from England. Around the foot was a wreath of
fifteen fleurons, each containing pearls, and also four St. Andrew’s crosses
comprising eighteen pearls each. The interior of the cup showed scenes from
the life of St. George and was studded with pearls, while thirty-one pearl
pendants hung from the edge. 11,897 reals (about $1700).<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c017'><sup>[474]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Some curious jewels, belonging to Queen Margarita, wife of Philip
III of Spain, were entered in an inventory made in 1611.</p>

<p class='c020'>An imperial eagle, full of diamonds, that came from England, with two
pendants of two pearls, which could be unhooked from the said eagle and
were worn by her Majesty at two masks as earrings. Valued at 77,000 reals
(about $11,000).</p>

<p class='c020'>Gold earrings, enameled in various colors, with seven diamonds in each one
and three pendant pearls, two small ones of equal size and the other shaped like
a pear. Valued at 1320 reals ($188).<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c017'><sup>[475]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>In the older Spanish jewelry pearls were frequently entirely pierced
through, as if they had been worn in necklaces; and if hung as drops
of one to three or more, they were strung on a wire, the upper end
usually forming an ornament, and they were kept from falling off below
by flattening the lower end of the wire, this flattening acting as a
stop. These styles have a marked resemblance to the oriental methods
elsewhere described, and suggest the derivation of the early Spanish
pearl mounting from the Moorish occupation of the country. If they
were set singly on any part of the jewel, they were put on a wire peg
fastened to it, and then the end of the wire which projected was hammered
flat to keep the pearl in place. Excellent examples of these
styles are the Spanish earrings in the collection of the Hispano-American
Museum of New York. The same method was used in Transylvania
in the seventeenth century with remarkably artistic effect.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearls of the Virgin of the Rosary in the church of St. Domingo,
Lima, were famous. It is believed that they were sold in the
war of independence. Those of the monstrance in the sanctuary of
the cathedral of Lima were sold during the last war with Chile. The
monstrance of the cathedral of Cuzco still shows pearls and emeralds,
but they are of small size.</p>

<p class='c013'>A lady who left a great fortune in pearls to the church of Nazareno
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>and the House of the Poor of the church of St. Peter, Lima, was Doña
Maria Fernandez de Córdoba, from the family of Borda, grandmother
to the minister of Peru in Washington. She was a descendant of
Hernan Cortés and of Pizarro by her ancestor Carmen Cortés.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pearls of Lima figure prominently in the history of the Peruvian
families. The war of independence, which ended in 1822, was followed
by the suppression of the entailed estates; this forced a division
of the family fortunes, and it became necessary to sell the family
jewels in Europe. Thither went all the famous pearls of the Peruvian
aristocracy, whose luxury is proven by the fact that in 1780 there were
in Lima no less than two thousand private carriages.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the most remarkable uses of Bohemian pearls was that of a
large triptych owned by Count Moritz of Lobkowitz and Duke of
Raudnitz. It measured six or more feet in height. The entire borders
were ornamented with pearls. The center of the triptych represented
the ascension of Christ on a chariot drawn by lambs. In the panel to
the right was the Angel Gabriel, and to the left the Virgin Mary praying.
The borders and lettering were magnificently embroidered and
decorated in Bohemian pearls. This object probably dated from the
sixteenth or early part of the seventeenth century. It was estimated
by one of the authors to contain at least one hundred thousand pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madame Zelie Nuttal, the great Maya scholar, personally writes
that pearls are not mentioned either as articles of tribute or of decoration
in ancient Mexican codices; possibly a lack of fine, hard instruments
with which to drill holes in pearls may have caused them to be
comparatively little used in personal adornment. Neither do they appear
to have been found incrusted in prehistoric objects, and we have
no written evidence of their having been used in this way. We do not
know of any instances of the wearing of pearls by the Indian women,
but the women of the higher classes used to wear them profusely, more
especially drop-earrings and pendants. Madame Nuttal also communicates
as follows:</p>

<p class='c020'>Bernadino de Sahagun states: “There are also pearls in New Spain, and
they are familiar to everybody. They are named epyollotti,<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c017'><sup>[476]</sup></a> which means
the heart of the shell, because they are formed in the shell of the oyster.” In
Molina’s dictionary “seed-pearls” are named “piciltic epyollotti,” which means
“water-stars,” a poetical name, composed of the word a = att = water, and cittallin
= star. The latter name leads us to infer the possibility that the “star-skirt,
or skirt of, or with stars,” the “cittallin icue” of the living image of the
goddess “Tlamateculitti” was decorated with <i>pearls</i>, although it is only described
(Book II, chap. 36) as being “of leather, cut into strips at the bottom
(forming a fringe), at the end of each of which hung a small shell named
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>‘cueclitti’ which reproduced a sound when she walked.” As it is stated that
this “star-skirt” was worn over “a white one” it seems as though it must have
been of the kind, represented in codices and sculptures, made of openwork and
netlike, and studded with round objects—possibly pearls—at the crossings or
in the centers of the open spaces.</p>

<p class='c013'>Oil-paintings of the madonnas represent them with robes richly
embroidered with pearls, and wearing “ropes of pearls.” The Virgin
of the Rosario, in the church at Santo Domingo, Mexico, was noted
for her pearls, and there is a small oil-painting of this virgin, in which
she is depicted with a wealth of pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Bohemian National Exposition, held at Prague in 1891,
Count Schwarzenberg exhibited four embroideries, each fourteen by
eight inches. They were embroidered with Bohemian pearls found
on his domains a century or more previous, and contained many thousands
of pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Hungary pearls have always been the favorite jewels, especially
among the aristocracy, and they have served to adorn the national
costume of both men and women. A century ago nearly every family
of distinction owned a necklace, but most of the pearls were small and
of indifferent quality. Since that time fine pearls have become more
usual, and many wealthy Hungarian families have acquired beautiful
pearls of good size and excellent quality, and many splendid necklaces
can now be seen in Hungary. The following are some of the finest:</p>

<p class='c020'>A necklace of three large rows, owned by the Archduke Joseph and valued
at one million francs.</p>

<p class='c020'>A still larger necklace in the possession of Prince Nicholas Esterhazy; this,
however, is an entailed heirloom, and may not be parted with without the
king’s permission.</p>

<p class='c020'>A very fine necklace of five rows, also an entailed heirloom, owned by Count
Maurice Esterhazy.</p>

<p class='c020'>A large necklace, possessed by Countess Alois Karoly, wife of the late ambassador
in London. This is another entailed heirloom; its value is at least
a million and a half francs.</p>

<p class='c020'>An unusually large necklace of four rows, such as one rarely sees, owned
by the Countess Wenkheim. The pearls are white, and have a good shape,
but not much brilliancy. The average size of these pearls is approximately
twenty-four grains.</p>

<p class='c020'>An equally large necklace consisting of a single row, averaging twenty-six
grains, in the possession of Countess Louis Batthyani.</p>

<p class='c020'>There are a great many other necklaces of fine quality, worth from 300,000
francs down to 100,000 francs, belonging to families such as those of Count
Joseph Hunyadi, Countess Festetics-Hamilton, Count Landor Nako, Peer
Leo Lanczi, Count Albert Apponyi, Mr. Eugene Dreher, Madame Emma de
Bachrach, etc., etc. Indeed, almost every wealthy family of the better class
owns a necklace worth up to 100,000 francs and over.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>The portraits of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries
afford us many interesting evidences regarding the various forms of
jewelry in which pearls were used. Indeed, had we no other records,
these pictures alone would prove the great popularity of the gem as an
ornament.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the finely executed portrait of the Duchess Anne de France, she
wears a coronet with three pearls at each point. It seems to be made
up of three large pearls, set on a row of pearls circling the entire top
of her head, beneath which is a row of great emeralds, and then another
row of pearls. Flaring downward and entirely covering the side
of her head near the ear, are two rows of pearls with a row of fine
emeralds between them, the rows of pearls deflecting slightly downward
until the chin line is reached, and then turning back and slightly
upward, meeting at the back. As in the crown cap, the same severe
decoration in pearls is the main feature, and is repeated on each side of
the robe, the front of which is of ermine. Beginning on a line with the
shoulder is a broad band of pearls and emeralds set in gold which extends
below her waist. At the top of this are six pearls set in a straight
line. Then from the end of this line, dropping straight down, is a row
on each side. Between the two rows is a gem, then two great pearls
and another gem, then two more pearls, this being repeated to below
the waist. The ermine is held at her waist by a trefoil reversed; that
is, two pearls above and one below a great gem, and then a trefoil reversed
below this. This portrait is dated 1498 and is on a triptych in
the cathedral of Moulins.</p>

<p class='c013'>Quite unique is the pearl decoration in a picture of St. Barbara,
painted by an artist of the French school, and dated 1520, which is in
the National Museum of Budapest. This artist uses pearls with the
utmost severity of taste and richness. Beginning a trifle above the center
of her forehead is an emerald ornament, and on each side there extend
to the back of her head three rows of pearls, not placed exactly
one row above the other, but the rows intertwined with each other.
The whole is enriched by a great string of pearls about her neck. The
effect produced is extremely artistic and beautiful.</p>

<p class='c013'>Catharine de’ Medici wore two rows of pearls on her bonnet, and a
quaint necklace in sections of two rows of four pearls, with a large
pearl between; a pear-shaped pendant on a Renaissance jewel; a row of
pearls around her low-cut bodice, and a girdle of jewels alternating
with pearls, which extended to the lower end of her gown. In addition
to all this, she wore a bracelet of jewels with a pearl set between each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>ornament. This artistic combination is best shown in her portrait in
the Uffizi, Florence (No. 726), painted by an unknown artist.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the most unique, rich, and chic collections of pearls, and one
worn with unusual grace, is that of the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia,
shown in the fine portrait of her by Coello Sanchez. In this portrait
her hat shows the plumes embroidered with slanting rows of three,
four, and five pearls. In the center of the hat is an ornament shaped
like a flower, with seven large pearl petals surrounding a great pearl
center. The hat is tilted to one side showing her hair on the left, while
a little to the right of the center of her forehead, and touching it, there
hangs from her hair a great pear-shaped pearl, which adds a wonderful
amount of character to the jeweling of her head. Around her neck
is a high fluted ruff; below which is a collar of large gems relieved by
an ornament of two pearls placed between each gem. The same interesting
motive is carried out in a girdle of gems which comes down very
low to her waist, terminating in a large jeweled heart ornament. The
painting shows sixteen remarkable pearls in the collar, and thirty-six
pearls in the jeweled girdle.</p>

<p class='c013'>A very interesting collection of portraits was exhibited last spring
(1907) at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. The pictures are contained,
in some instances, in old illuminated manuscripts, while in
others they are contemporary crayon sketches. Many pearl decorations
are represented, and we give a few of the most important.</p>

<p class='c020'>The portrait of Anne de Bretagne (1476–1514), wife of Louis XII, from
the “Heures d’Anne de Bretagne,” illuminated by Jean Bourdichon, represents
the queen kneeling; she wears a collar ornamented with groups of four pearls
alternating with precious stones.</p>

<p class='c020'>A crayon sketch of Françoise de Foix, Comtesse de Châteaubriant (1490–1537),
who became the mistress of Francis I, shows her wearing a hood or
coif ornamented with forty oval pearls. She also wears a necklace of sixty
fine round pearls.</p>

<p class='c020'>Diane de Poitiers (1499–1566), granddaughter of Charles VII and Agnes
Sorel, is represented with a head-dress similar to that worn by the Comtesse de
Châteaubriant . It has a border of sixty round pearls. This crayon is of the
time of Jean Clouet.</p>

<p class='c020'>A portrait of Philip Strozzi (1541–1582) who, although an Italian, had the
rank of colonel-général in the French army, is interesting as an illustration of
the wearing of earrings by the men of this period. The fine round pearl
which hangs from his ear strikes us now as a curious ornament for a warrior.</p>

<p class='c020'>A crayon sketch of Gabrielle d’Estrées (d. 1599), mistress of Henri IV,
is attributed to the hand of Daniel Dumonstier. Here may be seen a splendid
pearl necklace, which apparently consists of six sections, each comprising three
rows of eight round pearls, the sections being connected with each other by a
large oval pearl. The necklace, which hangs down over the bosom, is fastened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>by a clasp in the form of a four-leaved clover, from which depend two
other sections similar to those described above, and terminating in an oval
pearl pendant.</p>

<p class='c020'>The portrait of the Duchesse de Montpensier (1627–1693), the “Grande
Mademoiselle” of Mme. de Sévigné’s letters, is from the “Maximes de nostre
salut,” dedicated to the duchess by the author, M. de la Serre, and is attributed
to Nicolas Jarry. It represents the duchess wearing a beautiful necklace of
round pearls and a large pear-shaped pearl earring, while another pear-shaped
pearl depends from a clasp which serves to loop up her fichu on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c013'>A fine example of the Renaissance style existing in the sixteenth
century is that of a gold and enamel necklace of Italian workmanship,
embellished with pearls. This necklace was presented to the Louvre
Museum by Don A. de Rotschildt. The two-pearl motive is carried
out exquisitely, two pearls appearing in a small connecting ornament
between two larger enameled and engraved gold plaques, which represent
scenes from the life of our Saviour.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the exposition of 1900 there was shown in the Russian Pavilion,
a most interesting collection of jewelry of decidedly oriental character,
dating from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century. These jewels
were said to have belonged to the Emir of Bokhara. They differed
slightly from the East Indian in character, and generally consisted of
combinations of pearls, rubies, and emeralds, the three colors of these
gems predominating. One of the most interesting of the necklaces,
acquired by J. Gelatley, Esq., shows an arrangement of the pearls
which is peculiarly attractive and decorative.</p>

<p class='c013'>The heraldic significance of pearls has at times been very important.
While in the eighteenth century the crowns of the French nobles
were surmounted with silver points, it appears that in the sixteenth
century they were provided with pearl points. According to Rudolphus,<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c017'><sup>[477]</sup></a>
the dukes wore a leaf crown of eight leaves, with or without as
many commingled pearl points; the marquises a crown of four leaves
with twelve pearl points, or with four groups of three pearls set one
over the other; and the counts, a pearl crown which sometimes had
four pearls in each corner, one above the other. The viscounts wore a
gold ring set with four pearls, and the barons a gold ring entwined
with pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>The same is true of the English coronets. Instead of the pearls
which they bore at an earlier period, silver balls are now used on those
of the English barons, viscounts, earls, and marquises. This change
probably owed its origin to the desire on the part of the sovereigns to
confine the official use of pearls and other precious stones to themselves.
The rules at the coronation of Edward VII forbade the use of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>pearls except as a special royal privilege. The earl’s coronet has eight
balls raised on points, with gold strawberry leaves between the points.
The marquis wears one with four gold strawberry leaves and four
silver balls alternating, the latter raised above the rim.<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c017'><sup>[478]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A pearl and gold ring, formerly belonging to Washington, is now
in the possession of Vice-Chancellor E. B. Learning, of Camden, N. J.
It bears in the center a lock of Washington’s hair under a conical glass,
around which is a setting of blue and white enamel with a square of
red at each corner. The whole is surrounded by a circle of thirteen
pearls. This ring was presented by Washington to Lieutenant Richard
Somers prior to the latter’s departure on the expedition against the
Algerine pirates in Tripoli, in the course of which he lost his life. Before
his departure he left the ring with his sister, Sarah Keen. Vice-Chancellor
Leaming’s paternal grandmother inherited it as heir to
Somers’s estate, and from her it descended successively to her son and
grandson. The lock of Washington’s hair is admitted to be one of
only three now existing, of the other two, one is at Washington’s headquarters
at Newburg and the other in the museum at Boston. The
ring was exhibited at the Centennial Exposition in 1876.</p>

<p class='c013'>And what a wealth of pearls was seen at the marriage of the late
Emperor Frederick III of Germany with Princess Victoria, in 1858!
The wedding gift of the bridegroom consisted of a necklace of thirty-six
enormous pearls, three superb ones in the middle, and graduated
in size toward the ends. From her mother, Queen Victoria, the bride
received a diamond necklace and three massive brooches set with unusually
large pearls; and from Prince Albert, a magnificent hair-net
of pearls, diamonds, and emeralds. The king and queen of Prussia
presented a diadem of brilliants surrounded with a splendid circlet of
pearls. On the day of her entry into Berlin, the queen bestowed on the
bride a costly brooch of pearls and diamonds, representing a bouquet,
the leaves of which consisted of diamonds, while the flowers themselves
were of pear-shaped pearls of large size, one weighing 160
grains, and fourteen of them weighing 600 grains together.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the most splendid and best known collection of pearls, and
one worn with as much grace as any in Europe, consists of those owned
by the dowager Queen Margherita of Italy, whose name signifies pearl,
and who has always been fond of the ocean jewel. Her husband, King
Humbert, made her many presents of this regal gem. A photograph,
signed by the queen and sent to us for this volume by her gracious
courtesy, shows her wearing her magnificent twelve strings of pearls,
a pearl bracelet, and a pearl tiara with pear-shaped pearl tips.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>At the coronation of Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, beside her
coronation crown, the latter wore many of her richest and most beautiful
jewels. These consisted of seven immense rows of pearls, each
twenty-four to thirty inches in length, hanging below five large
neck circlets of diamonds and a great corsage ornament which covered
her entire bodice; and beneath part of this was a splendid ornament
of diamonds with large, pear-shaped pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>A careful study of the decorations conferred by potentates and governments
shows that the pearl is rarely used in the ornamentation of
these marks of distinction. A notable exception is that given by the
Siamese government. This decoration is known as the nine-jewel
Siamese decoration, and bears a large center pearl. It is only conferred
on nine members of the royal Siamese family, including his
Majesty the King of Siam. The central pearl represents the king and
the eight other jewels surrounding it the members of his family. It
is strange that Siam should find so much significance in white, as is
illustrated by the white elephant, and also by the use of the white pearl
for this order.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Order of Christ, the chief Portuguese order, has a long cross
enameled in bright red surcharged with a white cross and bordered
with fine pearls. The effect is both striking and beautiful.</p>

<p class='c013'>The order of the crown of India is a jeweled badge with a device
composed of the imperial cipher, E. R. and I., in diamonds, pearls, and
turquoises, set within a border of pearls and surmounted by the imperial
crown.<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c017'><sup>[479]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A remarkable pearl necklace was recently the subject of litigation in
England. It was the property of the late Duchess of Sermonata, an
Englishwoman who married an Italian. She was a daughter of the
late Lord Howard de Walden, one of the wealthiest of the English
nobility. The duchess was in the habit of investing all her spare cash
in pearls, and it seems that she chose a very good form of investment,
since pearls have increased in value to a greater extent even than diamonds
during the same period. Of the ten rows of which this necklace
consisted, six were deposited for safekeeping in a London bank
and the other four were in Florence at the time of the death of the
duchess. She had bequeathed the gems at the bank to her niece, Miss
Henrietta Ellis, and had left directions that, if her pearl necklace was
in London when she died, it should be sent to her Italian executors.
All the jewels are now claimed by these executors, while Miss Ellis
contends that it was the intention of the duchess to leave to her the
pearls in the hands of the London bankers. The necklace consisted at
one time of ten rows; the first, thirteen and a half inches long, comprised
forty-one pearls; the second, fourteen inches in length, thirty-nine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>pearls; the third, fourteen and a half inches, forty-three pearls;
the fourth, seventeen inches, forty-seven pearls; the fifth, seventeen
and a half inches, forty-nine pearls; the sixth, nineteen and a half
inches, fifty-five pearls; the seventh, twenty-one inches, sixty-six
pearls; the eighth, twenty-three and a half inches, seventy pearls; the
ninth, twenty-six inches, eighty-two pearls; the tenth, twenty-nine and
a half inches, ninety-one pearls. The total number of pearls is 583,
and the necklace is valued at $150,000.</p>

<p class='c013'>A widely advertised necklace of large size was shown in the English
section of the Paris Exposition of 1900. This necklace consisted of
forty-six pearls weighing 1596 grains, and was valued at $450,000. It
was loaned by an English gentleman now dead, and was returned to
him at the close of the exposition and later dispersed.</p>

<p class='c013'>In regard to the possession of pearls by families in the United States,
we may safely say that there is not a letter in the alphabet under which
we cannot find the names of from one to a dozen families, owning
single strings or collections from the value of $10,000 to $200,000,
or even more. If one is a wearer of jewels, pearls are an absolute
necessity; indeed, they are as essential and indispensable for the
wealthy as are houses, horses, and automobiles. At no period in the
world’s history have pearls been more widely distributed; and some of
those of to-day are finer in quality and orient, and also more carefully
matched, than those in the great collections of the past. Of course
there are exceptions, where royal personages have been careful observers
and have used good taste, but it is a question whether there
have ever been more critical or better buyers, as far as selection is
concerned, than are many American men and women who have purchased
this gem.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the largest pearl necklaces in the United States is in the possession
of an American lady. There are perhaps thirty pearls in the
necklace, weighing in all about 1400 grains; the largest pearl weighs
nearly 120 grains. There is also one of 75 grains and one of 70
grains, the others graduating down to 20 grains.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>With increasing wealth, and a demand for rich rather than gaudy
or showy jewelry, there is nothing that commends itself so highly as
the pearl, which acts as a foil to the diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire,
and at the same time harmonizes with them and in fact with all
the colored stones. The true pearl, as it increases in size and beauty,
becomes proportionately more rare and costly; and yet it differs from
other jewels in the fact that they are mined in the depths of the earth,
and their existing quantity is speculative, while the home of the pearl
is much more accessible, and it is possible to make an estimate of the
number of pearls in course of growth. Pearls, however, are forming
all the time, while other gems are perhaps to-day as they were ages before
the advent of man. Nevertheless, even if pearls were cultivated as
they should be, and people cared for the mollusks as the oyster-gatherer
does for his crop—by planting it, guarding it and gathering it
systematically—still, the ever-increasing demand would more than balance
the greater supply. As we have said, at no time since pearls were
worn have they enjoyed such favor; and while they have always increased
in value, this increase has never been so rapid as in the past
ten years. They are jewels which can be worn by young or old, and
which adapt themselves to every fabric that man or woman can use for
attire; whether they are white, gray, or black, they are never obtrusive,
but always have a refining effect. Round as the globe upon which we
live, they will probably be worn and appreciated as long as life exists
upon this sphere.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is interesting to note the change of taste and the difference of
opinion, at various epochs, in regard to the respective merits of pear-shaped
and round pearls. In the Roman period the pear-shaped pearls
were more highly valued; in the eighteenth century round pearls were
esteemed the more valuable, while at the present day they are both on
about the same basis.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the progressive twentieth century taste for independence in
fashion, our modern ladies take from every epoch what they think will
best suit their superrefined beauty. Therefore we are not surprised to
find in their jewel-cases the long earrings and large brooches adorned
with seed-pearls, similar to those worn by their grandmothers of the
early Victorian period. Although these jewels cannot be considered
very beautiful according to the artistic standard of to-day, they, nevertheless,
lend to their wearers a certain quaint dignity and piquancy
which is very attractive.</p>

<p class='c013'>As an instance of modern pearl-wearing by a lady of the present
century, we may note a portrait in which there is a simple necklace of
large pearls; over this a collar of twenty-three rows of pearls with a
diamond centerpiece, and to relieve the severity, a sautoir, which is
made up of alternate pearls and diamonds, and pearl earrings. No
better illustration can be given than the portrait of Señora Carmen
Romero Rubio de Diaz, wife of President Porfirio Diaz of Mexico,
which, by her courtesy, we are able to figure.</p>

<p class='c013'>The gathering of a great necklace is not the work of a day; it often
requires many years. Such necklaces are frequently held for a long
time by dealers or by a number of people who are interested in their
sale, and whenever one or more pearls can be purchased which form a
better graduation or which are of better color or more perfect, they are
usually purchased to improve the necklace if the price is a proper one.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>In the early sixties, when most American women aspired to owning
a pair of diamond earrings, it was not uncommon for ladies to start
with a hundred, two hundred, five hundred, or a thousand-dollar pair,
and, for a dozen years to come, to add an annual sum of one hundred,
two hundred or five hundred dollars to increasing the size of these by
exchanging them with the dealer at the cost price and paying the difference
between the value of the pair that had been purchased and that
of the new pair. In this way ladies who never would have thought of
spending five thousand dollars for a pair of earrings, virtually made a
savings-bank of the jewels. This is frequently done with pearls. A
small necklace or a few pearls will be purchased; these are added to
annually or at such times as the owner may have spare savings or gifts
to invest. It is not uncommon for a family to buy a pearl for a daughter
on her first birthday, and each succeeding year add one pearl to
this, so that she may first wear one pearl, then two, then three, and by
the time the young lady makes her début in society, a good start has
been made toward a pearl necklace. It was the custom of King Humbert
of Italy to present his queen, Margherita, with one fine pearl
every year, and with this succession of annual gifts she possessed one
of the finest collections in Europe.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the portraits of the four daughters of the present Czarina of
Russia, the Grand Duchesses Tatiana, Olga, Maria, and Anastasia, we
can see that their pearl necklaces were built up gradually, as that of the
eldest daughter is notably longer than those of her younger sisters.
These pearls were annual gifts from the Czar and Czarina and from
others of the imperial family.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are few ornaments worn by man or woman that have not at
one time or another been bepearled, either with large or small pearls,
with one pearl or many pearls, with pearls of high or low degree, and
no object is ever made the less rich by the addition of the peerless gem
of the ocean depths.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the prices of pearls have increased, naturally the single objects
containing them have also become more costly. It is not unusual to see
rings with pearls each costing from $5000 to $10,000, $20,000, and
even $30,000 and over, the pearls not infrequently being in button form.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rings are occasionally made up of one white and one black oriental
pearl, and if a pink one is combined with these, it is either a fresh-water
or a conch pearl. Such rings sell for $5000, $8000, $10,000 and
$15,000 each.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pendant pearls, either round, ovate, drop, or pear-shaped, sell from
$5000 to $10,000, $20,000, $50,000, and even $100,000.</p>

<p class='c013'>The prices for one or two choice pearls worn for the adornment of a
man’s shirt-front are $2000, $3000, $5000, and even $10,000.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>In link buttons, slightly ovate, button or round pearls are used, the

<p class='c013'>It is not unusual for a man to wear a scarf-pin set with a round,
ovate, or pear-shaped pearl costing $2000, $5000, $10,000, $15,000,
and even $30,000.</p>

<p class='c013'>For men’s scarf-pins, a variety of colors are frequently selected,
such as a white oriental, a pink American, a pink conch, or a gray and

$200 to $500; sometimes, however, when fine pearls are used, the price
paid for a set of five or six buttons is as high as $10,000.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is scarcely possible to mention all the various forms in which the
pearl has been worn: whether as a spray of many small pearls or a few
large ones, either round, ovate, or pear-shaped for aigrets; in points
on crowns, used either for ornamental or heraldic purposes; for the
decoration of the orbs, scepters, and crowns of kings and emperors;
for forming an edging on bonnets, caps, fillets, or diadems; in pendant
form, usually consisting of one, although sometimes of three or four
pendants in rows and lines to ornament the side of the face; or one,
two, three, or a bunch together to adorn the ear; as a single pearl on a
wire or a group of them, as worn in the nose of the East Indian beauty;
as a single, two, three, or many-rowed necklace to grace the lady, the
queen, and the empress; or else in six, ten, to twenty or more rows with
a tiny gold jeweled bar, or a large diamond center, in the form of collars;
as a long chain from four to ten feet long to hang from the neck
to the waist, or else to be worn once, twice, or thrice around the neck,
hanging down and then encircling the waist in the form of a sautoir;
either as a single drop, consisting of an ovate or pear-shaped pearl or
a number of them together in the form of a pendant combined with
diamonds; as a single pearl surrounded with pearls or diamonds for
buttons to adorn my lady’s crown; in rows, or combined with jewels
and enamel, in the form of a bow-knot with long bunches of pearls, for
shoulder bars; either as one pearl alone or alternating with gold wire,
with jewels, or with many pearls, in endless forms, as bracelets; either
as a single row, two rows or alternate rows in infinite variety on
bodices, as worn in the past more than at the present; in a single row
on ornamenting metal, enamel, or jewelwork in the form of girdles; in
five hundred forms for rings; as an embroidery or in rows pendant on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>slippers; and, finally, as a stole. These are only a few of the uses to
which a lady can put pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>By men, pearls are worn to adorn the shirt, to wear in the scarf, as
link buttons, as waistcoat buttons, or as a fob. The pearls used in this
way are sometimes quite as expensive as any of those worn by the
ladies.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ecclesiastics, for more than two thousand years, have appreciated
the richness of bepearling. In Russia we find pearls decorating crosses,
missal covers, vestments, bindings on books, chalices and crook-tops;
they are employed as borders to ikon frames, or for the decoration
about the Madonna and Child. In Persia we find pearl-embroidered
rugs, pillows, and bolsters. Half-pearls are used in quaint decorations
for watches, snuff-boxes, miniatures, and portrait frames. Even saddles
and horse-trappings in the East do not escape the charm and
beauty of the pearl. Even the English coronation spoon is known for
the pearls which ornament it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the many forms of earrings that have come down to us, none is
simpler or daintier than a single pearl worn as an ear-screw, or partly
or entirely strung on a thin gold wire. Another dainty style is three
pearls, worn one below the other as in ancient Rome, known as a triclum;
or the round pearl with a pear-shaped pendant or bunches of
pearls known as crotalia, also worn in ancient times.</p>

<p class='c013'>A pearl necklace is usually clasped either by a round or ovate pearl,
drilled so that the catch and snap are contained within the pearl itself,
or else by a pearl surrounded by diamonds, rubies, or other gems. Such
a clasp frequently serves to bind from two to fifteen rows of pearls,
the first or smaller row encircling the neck, and each row in turn being
larger until the fifteenth row reaches to the bosom or even to the waist.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pearl collars are usually made up of four, six, ten, twenty, and even
twenty-five rows; often of very small pearls, generally fitting closely
to the neck. The pearls are held in position either by four gold, diamond,
or jeweled bars, or frequently the entire front of the collar is
occupied by a large diamond ornament.</p>

<p class='c013'>In ancient times, pearls were a favorite decoration of crosses; frequently
an entire cross was made up of pearls, either of a single or a
double row. Many portraits dating from the fifteenth to the seventeenth
century show the cross used in connection with a necklace, this
either starting from the top of the cross or from each side at the end
of each arm. Sometimes from below the arms and the lower part of
the cross there hung pendant either round or pear-shaped pearls. We
have other instances where at the top, the cross was attached to a pearl
necklace, while below each of the two arms there hung a pearl, and
from the lower part of the cross a double necklace again reached to the
back of the neck. Frequently a festoon collar will be made up of five
rows of pearls, each of a graduated length, and pendant on each a
diamond. Recently pearls have been drilled and invisibly joined by fine
platinum links, so as to form a continuous ribbon or even a collar two
inches wide; occasionally, a Greek border or some other design, of
larger pearls or of diamonds, rubies, sapphires or other gems, is interwoven.
This constitutes a veritable, smooth pearl cloth, or pearl mesh,
very beautiful and also comfortable to wear. Indeed, a purse, measuring
five by six inches, has been made of this cloth of pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>Dust-pearls, too minute to drill, and numbering over 100,000 to the
ounce, were used, in the latter part of the eighteenth and the early part
of the nineteenth centuries, for the embellishment of the hair-work
then so much in favor and which was placed under glass. Where
foliage was represented the leaves were made of the most minute seed-pearls,
graduated in size and set on an outline of enamel or white paint,
the pearls being cemented to the outline. This added a softness to the
hair-work and other decoration.</p>

<p class='c013'>As long as the pearl has been known, there has been a desire to obtain
possession of one in some of its degrees of perfection, and for this
reason many attempts have been made to prepare something that
might pass for a pearl or even suggest a pearl. Sometimes the mother-of-pearl
shell has, naturally, a protuberance, either round or pear-shaped,
which, if cut off and highly polished may resemble an imperfect
pearl; and this operation is often so cleverly performed that, at
the first glance, this object may pass for a true pearl. In Russia, and
especially in Bohemia, they have gone farther than this. They have
cut out a bit of mother-of-pearl shell, leaving a piece of the natural
shell for the top, or the part that will be visible, and rounding off the
rest of the surface so as to give it a pearly effect. These objects are of
trifling value and are used in necklaces and earrings, and in the ornamentation
of icons and miniature frames and even as beads. Glass
with either an exterior or interior coating of a nacreous substance is
sometimes made absolutely round, while at other times it is made with
many imperfections so as to resemble either a marine baroque or a
fresh-water irregular pearl. The North American Indian, as described
elsewhere, has coated little balls of clay with a powder made
from a pearl-bearing fresh-water mussel and then baked them.</p>

have become famous, either because of their intrinsic value or
else through historic associations. An attempt is made here to
list briefly the more important of these. While we have purposely
omitted any mention of the pearl collections in private hands at
the present time, some of which are more valuable than many of those
noted in the following pages, we have, nevertheless, given the principal
sales of pearls at auction during the past twenty years. Many
specimens of remarkable size and beauty have changed hands in this
way, more especially in England.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Cleopatra Pearls.</span> Next to that “pearl of great price,” mentioned by
Christ, probably the most famous of all pearls were the two which
Pliny records as having been worn in the ears of Cleopatra, “the singular
and onely jewels of the world and even Nature’s wonder.” This
writer does not note their size, but estimates their value at sixty million
sestertii. We have already quoted the passage in which Pliny
relates how one of these pearls was dissolved and swallowed by Cleopatra
in order to win a wager she had made with Antony. After the
death of that queen the other pearl “was cut in twaine, that in memoriall
of that one halfe supper of theirs, it should remaine unto posterite,
hanging at both the eares of Venus at Rome in the temple of
Pantheon.”<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c017'><sup>[480]</sup></a> Budé estimated the value of the pearl dedicated to Venus
at 250,000 <i>escus</i> of gold.<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c017'><sup>[481]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Another famous pearl mentioned by Pliny was the one which Julius
Cæsar presented to Servilia, mother of Brutus, the value of which he
notes as six million sestertii.<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c017'><sup>[482]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span><span class='sc'>Peroz Pearl.</span> The historian Procopius,<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c017'><sup>[483]</sup></a> of the sixth century, tells of
a magnificent pearl which belonged to Peroz, or Firuz (459–484),
one of the Sassanian kings of Persia. In the course of his disastrous
battle with the White Huns, in which both he and his sons perished,
Peroz, having a presentiment of the misfortune about to befall him,
took the pearl from his right ear and cast it away, lest any one should
wear it after him. This pearl is described as being “such as no king
had ever worn up to that time.” Procopius, however, thinks it more
probable that the ear of Peroz was cut off in the combat, and he states
that the emperor (Zeno, 426–491) was very anxious to buy the gem
from the Huns, but that all search for it was in vain. Nevertheless,
a rumor was current that it was recovered later, but that another
pearl was substituted for it and sold to Kobad, a successor of Peroz.</p>

<p class='c013'>A different version is given by Panciroli,<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c017'><sup>[484]</sup></a> who quotes Zonaras, a
Byzantine historian of the twelfth century, as his authority. According
to this version Justinian the Great, who succeeded to the throne
forty-three years after the death of Peroz, offered one hundred pounds
of gold (about $25,000) for the pearl, but the barbarians refused to
part with it, preferring to keep it as a memorial of Persian folly. On
the coins of Peroz he is represented wearing an earring with three
pendants, one of which may have been this wonderful pearl.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Charles the Bold.</span> One of the greatest jewels of the fifteenth century
was that belonging to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy
(1433–1477). According to notes and drawings<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c017'><sup>[485]</sup></a> made in 1555 by J. J.
Fugger of Nuremberg, who was the banker jeweler of his generation,
this consisted of a large pyramid diamond five eighths of an inch square
at the base, with the apex cut as a four-rayed star in relief; surrounding
this were three rectangular pyramid-shaped rubies and three magnificent
pear-shaped pearls, and a large ovate pearl was suspended
from the lowest ruby. The pear pearls are described as measuring
half an inch in diameter and must have weighed about sixty grains
each. This magnificent jewel was probably the most celebrated in
Europe during the fifteenth century. According to Comines, on the
defeat of the Grand Duke and the plundering of his baggage by the
Swiss at Granson in 1476, the ornament was found by a careless soldier
who tossed it away, but retained the gold box containing it. On second
thought, he searched for and recovered the jewel and sold it to a
priest for one florin, and the ecclesiastic sold it to a Bernese government official for the sum of three florins. Some years later this jewel,
together with the ducal cap of Charles the Bold, which was covered
with pearls, and bore a plume case, set with diamonds (points), alternating
with pearls and balas-rubies, was sold by the Bernese government
to Jacob Fugger, as related by J. J. Fugger in the manuscript
above noted, “for no more than 47,000 florins.” In the vain hope that
it would be purchased by Emperor Charles V, grandson of Charles the
Bold, Fugger held the jewel for many years, but he broke up the cap
and reset the stones in it for Maximilian II. The brooch was finally
sold to Henry VIII of England just before his death, and it passed to
his daughter and successor, Bloody Mary, who presented it to her
Spanish bridegroom, Philip. Thus, after seventy-six years, the jewel
was restored to a descendant of the original owner. This history has
been given at some length owing to its illustration of the manner in
which great pearls were easily lost on battle-fields and were passed
about from one country to another.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span><span class='sc'>Tararequi Pearls.</span> The early American fisheries yielded several
magnificent pearls, many of which eventually became part of the imperial
Spanish jewels. Prominent among these was the <i>Huerfana</i> or
<i>Sola</i>. According to Gomara, this was secured in 1515 from the Indians
at Tararequi, in the Gulf of Panama, in a large collection which
weighed 880 ounces. It was pear-shaped and weighed thirty-one
carats. Gomara states that this pearl was purchased from Gaspar de
Morales, leader of the Spanish expedition, by a merchant, for the sum
of 12,000 castilians. “The purchaser could not sleep that night for
thinking on the fact that he had given so much money for one stone,
and sold it the very next day to Pedrarias de Avila, for his wife Donna
Isabel de Bovadilla”; and afterward it passed to Isabella, wife of Emperor
Charles V (1500–1558). It was remarkable for its luster, color,
and clearness, as well as for its size. Another large pearl in this collection
weighed twenty-six carats.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Oviedo Pearl.</span> As already noted on page 237, in his “Historia natural
y general de las Indias,” published at Toledo in 1526, Gonzalo de
Oviedo wrote of having purchased at Panama a pearl weighing
twenty-six carats for which he paid 650 times its weight in fine gold,
and which he claimed was the “greatest, fairest and roundest” that had
ever been seen at Panama. Probably this was the twenty-six-carat
pearl obtained at Tararequi by Gaspar de Morales in 1515. At
650 times its weight in gold the value of this pearl would be
$2294.54; representing a base of $.2124 per grain; but at a base of $5
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>per grain the same pearl would be worth $54,080, equaling 15,320
times its weight in gold.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Temple of Talomeco.</span> Among great collections of pearls, some writers
would place that described by Garcilasso de la Vega as having been
found by De Soto and his followers in 1540 in the Temple of Talomeco
near the Savannah River in America.<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c017'><sup>[486]</sup></a> According to Garcilasso, the
quantity of pearls there was so great that 300 horses and 900 men
would not have sufficed for its transportation, vastly excelling every
other if not all other collections in the history of the world. Unfortunately
the accuracy of this account has not been unquestioned.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>La Peregrina.</span> Most celebrated among the early American pearls
was La Peregrina (the incomparable), or the Philip II pearl, which
weighed 134 grains. According to Garcilasso de la Vega, who says
that he saw it at Seville in 1597,<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c017'><sup>[487]</sup></a> this was found at Panama in 1560 by
a negro who was rewarded with his liberty, and his owner with the office
of alcalde of Panama. Other authorities note that it came from the
Venezuelan fisheries in 1574. It was carried to Spain by Don Diego de
Temes, who presented it to Philip II (1527–1598). Jacques de Treco,
court jeweler to the king, is credited with saying that it might be worth
30,000, 50,000 or 100,000 ducats, as one might choose to estimate, for
in fact it was so remarkable as to be beyond any standard valuation.
If we can credit Garcilasso, at one time this pearl decorated the crown
of the Blessed Virgin in the church of Guadeloupe, which was resplendent
with gems.<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c017'><sup>[488]</sup></a> A contemporaneous account<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c017'><sup>[489]</sup></a> notes that it was
worn at Madrid by Queen Margarita, wife of Philip III, at the fêtes
given in celebration of the treaty of peace between that country and
England in 1605.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Charles II Pearl.</span> Somewhat similar to the foregoing was the pearl
of Charles II of Spain (1661–1700), which was presented to that
monarch by Don Pedro de Aponte, Conde del Palmer, a native of the
Canaries. This gem was found in 1691, or more than a century after
La Peregrina. These two pearls were nearly equal in size, and for
many years they were worn as earrings by the successive queens of
Spain. It is reported that they were destroyed in 1734, when a large
portion of the old palace at Madrid was burned.<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c017'><sup>[490]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>The jewels of the Spanish crown have passed through so many vicissitudes
that it is not surprising that but few of them remain in the
Spanish treasury. After the overthrow of the Spanish monarchy by
the French in 1808, Ferdinand VII, during the time of his exile, disposed
of many of these jewels. It is asserted that, after the deposition
of Queen Isabella, in 1868, the crown jewels were divided between
herself and her sister, the pious Duchesse de Montpensier, and a considerable
portion was eventually distributed among the numerous descendants
of the latter. It is also stated that there is no mention of
the Spanish crown jewels during the reign of King Amadeus, the first
sovereign of the restored monarchy. There are, however, great quantities
of pearls and other gems belonging to the various madonnas in
the Spanish churches, as, for example, Nuestra Señora de Atocha,
Cavadonga and others.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pearls of Mary Stuart.</span> The pearls owned by the unfortunate Mary
Queen of Scots (1542–1587) were among the most beautiful in Europe.
Inventories of these<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c017'><sup>[491]</sup></a> show great <i>bordures de tour</i> of large pear pearls
with <i>entredeux</i> of round pearls, long ropes of pearls strung like beads
on a rosary, carcans or broad belts set with pearls, and a large number
of loose pearls. Many of these appear in the portraits of this popular
queen; but probably the most remarkable exhibition of them is in the
portrait now owned by the Earl of Leven and Melville,<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c017'><sup>[492]</sup></a> which appears
to agree fairly well with the inventories of her jewels, although this
portrait is not wholly free from impeachment as to its accuracy and
contemporaneousness.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the downfall of the queen, most of her jewels were sold,
pawned, or lost by theft. A number of them passed into the possession
of Queen Elizabeth in 1568, in a manner not wholly satisfactory to
lovers of justice. Some of these were described in a letter dated
May 8, 1568, and addressed to Catharine de’ Medici by Bodutel de la
Forest, the French ambassador at the English court, as “six cordons of
large pearls, strung as paternosters; but there are about twenty-five
separate from the others much larger and more beautiful than those
which are strung. They were first shown to three or four jewelers
and lapidaries of this city, who estimated them at three thousand
pounds sterling, and who offered to give that sum; certain Italian
merchants who viewed them afterwards valued them at 12,000 <i>escus</i>,
which is the price, as I am told, this queen [Elizabeth] will take them
at. There is a Genevese who saw them after the others and estimated
them as worth 16,000 <i>escus</i> [$24,000].”<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c017'><sup>[493]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Catharine de’ Medici, who was a mother-in-law of Mary Stuart, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>very anxious to obtain these pearls; but the ambassador wrote on
May 15, 1568, that he had found it impossible to purchase them; for,
as he had told her from the first, they were intended for the gratification
of the Queen of England, who had purchased them at her own
price, and was even then in possession of them.<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c017'><sup>[494]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Queen Elizabeth’s Pearls.</span> Although in her youth she is said to
have had a distaste for personal decorations, in her later years Queen
Elizabeth entertained an extravagant fondness for pearls. In speaking
of her portraits, Horace Walpole says: “A pale Roman nose, a
head of hair loaded with crowns and powdered with diamonds, a vast
ruff, a vaster fardingale, and a bushel of pearls, are features by which
everybody knows at once the pictures of Queen Elizabeth.”<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c017'><sup>[495]</sup></a> And to
the end, her love for them was unabated, for in the last tragi-comic
scene of her life, to meet the Angel of Death himself, she was dressed
up in her most splendid jewels with great pearl necklaces and earrings
and pendants, as Paul Delaroche so successfully pictured in his
remarkable painting in the Louvre.</p>

<p class='c013'>The faded waxwork effigy of her, long preserved in Westminster
Abbey in that curious collection of effigies<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c017'><sup>[496]</sup></a>—the “Ragged Regiment,”
as Walpole called them—has a coronet of large spherical pearls in
wax, long necklaces of them, a great pearl-ornamented stomacher,
pearl earrings with large pear-shaped pendants, and even broad, pearl
medallions on the shoe-bows. In accordance with that singular custom
which prevailed from the time of Henry V (1422), to that of Queen
Anne (1714),<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c017'><sup>[497]</sup></a> this effigy lay on her coffin at the funeral and caused,
says Stow in his Chronicle, “such a general sighing, groning, and
weeping, as the like hath not beene seene or knowne in the memory of
man.” A contemporaneous poet wrote that when the corpse with the
effigy passed down the Thames to lie in state at Whitehall,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Fish wept their eyes of pearl quite out,</div>
      <div class='line'>And swam blind after.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Gresham Pearl.</span> During the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Sir Thomas
Gresham, the merchant prince, was credited with possessing a pearl
valued at £15,000, which he reduced to powder and drank in a glass of
wine to the health of the queen, in order to astonish the Spanish ambassador,
with whom he had laid a wager that he would give a more costly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>dinner than could the Spaniards.<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c017'><sup>[498]</sup></a> No other information regarding
this pearl seems available. The valuation certainly appears excessive
when compared with that of some other pearls of that period.</p>

<p class='c013'>We quote an item from Burgon,<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c017'><sup>[499]</sup></a> taken from the manuscript journal
kept by Edward VI:</p>

<p class='c020'>25 [April, 1551]. A bargaine made with the Fulcare for about 60,000 l.
that in May and August should be paid, for the deferring of it. First, that
the Foulcare should put it off for ten in the hundred. Secondly, that I should
buy 12,000 marks weight at 6 shilinges the ounce to be delivered at Antwerpe,
and so conveyed over. Thirdly, I should pay 100,000 crowns for a very faire
juel of his, four rubies marvelous big, one orient and great diamount, and one
great pearle.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Rudolph II Pearls.</span> The scientific, art-loving, but eccentric Rudolph
II (1552–1612), Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, gathered
about him at Prague a great collection of jewels and wealth of all sorts.
The values of his pearls and precious stones, of the gold and silver
articles, was estimated by the archæologist, Jules Cæsar Boulenger, at
seventeen millions of gold florins, which was a very considerable sum
at that time, as appears when we consider that one hundred gold florins
annually was deemed a good salary for an official at the emperor’s
court. De Boot mentions a pearl belonging to Rudolph II which
weighed “thirty carats and cost as many thousands of gold pieces.” It
is quite likely that this was the one noted by Gomara as coming from
the Gulf of Panama,<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c017'><sup>[500]</sup></a> and which Rudolph probably inherited from his
grandfather, Emperor Charles V. The pearl bought by Oviedo in
Panama, prior to 1526, may be one of the principal decorations of the
imperial crown of Austria.</p>

<p class='c013'>We read in that curious and interesting book, “The Generall Historie
of the Turkes,” by Richard Knolles,<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c017'><sup>[501]</sup></a> that Abbas the Great, Shah
of Persia (1557–1628), after having defeated the Turks in many battles,
desired to form an alliance with Emperor Rudolph II, and to induce
him to break his engagements with the Turks. To this end Shah
Abbas, in 1610 sent an embassy to Prague, with many valuable gifts
for the emperor, among which were “three orientall pearles exceeding
big.” It has been conjectured, and it is also claimed, that these may
be three of the eight pear-shaped pearls which are now to be seen in the
crown of Rudolph II. One of the largest pearls in the Austrian crown,
as we have stated, is most probably the Oviedo pearl.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span><span class='sc'>Charles I Pearl.</span> Admirers of Vandyke’s pictures of Charles I
(1600–1649) readily recall the pearl pendant from his right ear, which
appears in nearly all of his portraits by that artist. Janin wrote: “This
pearl in the ear of his majesty was greatly coveted, and as soon as his
head had fallen, the witnesses of the dreadful scene rushed forward,
ready to imbue their hands in his blood in order to secure the royal
jewel.” It seems more probable that the martyr king would have left
this gem in the hands of a trusty friend for his family than to the risk
of injury by the ax and to be torn from his mutilated head by a
scrambling mob.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Owing</span> to their control of the great fisheries, the most valuable collections
of pearls have been held by eastern monarchs, and particularly
by those of India and Persia. It has been estimated that one third of
the portable wealth of these countries is in jewels. Most Orientals are
as suspicious of interest in their jewels as they are of inquiry regarding
their harems, imagining, doubtless, that the interest conceals a
sentiment of cupidity, hence it is not practicable to give a minute description
of them. However, several travelers have recorded glowing
accounts of collections which they have examined, which read much
like a description of Aladdin’s palace in the Arabian Nights. Among
these, some of the greatest are the</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pearls described by Tavernier.</span> For accounts of remarkable pearls
in eastern countries in the seventeenth century, we are indebted to that
well-informed old French jeweler, Tavernier, one of the most remarkable
gem dealers the world has ever known. He made numerous journeys
to Persia, Turkey, Central Asia, and the East Indies, gaining the
confidence of the highest officials and trading in gems of the greatest
value. After amassing a large fortune and purchasing a barony near
Lake Geneva, he died at Moscow in 1689 while on a mercantile trip to
the Orient, at the age of eighty-four years. His “Voyages,” published
in 1676–1679, reveal a critical knowledge of gems, a remarkable insight
into human nature, and the absence of any intention to impart
misleading information.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the first English edition of his travels, published in 1678, Tavernier
gave sketches of five of the principal pearls which came under his
careful observation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Figure 1 of Tavernier’s diagram shows what he considered “the
largest and most perfect pearl ever discovered, and without the least
defect.” The weight of this pear-shaped gem does not appear to have
been noted, but from the sketch it may be estimated at about 500
grains. Tavernier states that the bloodthirsty Shah Sofi, King of
Persia, purchased it in 1633 from an Arab who had just received it
from the fisheries at El Katif. “It cost him 32,000 tomans, or 1,400,000
livres of our money, at the rate of 46 livres and 6 deniers per toman
($552,000).”<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c017'><sup>[502]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>Very much smaller but more beautiful than this great pearl, was the
one which Tavernier saw in 1670 at Ormus in the possession of the
Imam of Muscat, who had recently recovered the Muscat peninsula
from the Portuguese. The jeweler stated that although this weighed
only twelve and one sixteenth carats (forty-eight and a quarter
grains),<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c017'><sup>[503]</sup></a> and was not perfectly round, it surpassed in beauty all others
in the world at that time. It was so clear and lustrous as to appear
translucent. At the conclusion of a grand entertainment given by the
Khan of Ormus, at which Tavernier was present, the Prince of Muscat
drew this gem from a small purse suspended about his neck, and exhibited
it to the company. The Khan of Ormus offered 2000 tomans
(about $34,500) for it, but the owner would not part with his treasure.
Tavernier states that later the prince refused an offer of 40,000 <i>escus</i>
($45,000) from Aurangzeb, the Great Mogul of India.<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c017'><sup>[504]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Figure 3 in the diagram represents a pear-shaped pearl of fifty-five
carats (220 grains) which Tavernier sold to Shaista Khan, uncle of
the Grand Mogul. Although of large size and good shape, this was
deficient in luster. According to the jeweler, this pearl was from the
Island of Margarita on the Venezuelan coast, and was the largest ever
carried from Occident to Orient.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tavernier listed among the Great Mogul’s jewels a large olive-shaped
pearl, perfect in form and luster. The weight was not noted,
but from the sketch which he gave (see Fig. 4) it may be estimated at
about 125 grains. It formed the central ornament of a chain of emeralds
and rubies, which the Mogul sometimes wore about his neck. He
also listed a round pearl of perfect form (see Fig. 5). The weight of
this also is not noted, but from the sketch it may be estimated at 110
grains. This was the largest perfectly spherical pearl known to Tavernier.
Its equal had never been found, and for that reason it was kept
with the unmounted jewels.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the other pearl treasures of the Great Mogul, Tavernier
noted the following:</p>

<p class='c013'>(a) Two grand, pear-shaped pearls, one weighing about seventy
ratis,<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c017'><sup>[505]</sup></a> a little flattened on both sides, and of beautiful water and good
form. (b) A button-shaped pearl, weighing from fifty-five to sixty
ratis, of good form and good water. (c) A round pearl of great perfection,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>a little flat on one side and weighing fifty-six ratis; this had
been presented to the Great Mogul by Shah Abbas II, King of Persia.
(d) Three round yellowish pearls weighing from twenty-five to
twenty-eight ratis each. (e) A perfectly round pearl, thirty-five and
a half ratis, white and perfect in all respects. This was the only jewel
purchased by the Great Mogul himself, the others being inherited or
coming to him as presents. (f) Two pearls perfectly shaped and
equal, each weighing twenty-five and a quarter ratis. (g) Also two
chains, one of pearls and rubies of different shapes pierced like the
pearls; the other of pearls and emeralds, round and bored. All of these
pearls were round and ranged in weight from ten to twelve ratis each.<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c017'><sup>[506]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Peacock Throne.</span> The famous Takht-i-Tâ’ûs, or “Peacock Throne,”
at Delhi doubtless contained the greatest accumulation of gems in the
seventeenth century. It was completed, in the eighth year of his reign
(1044 <span class='fss'>A.H.</span>, 1634 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) by Shah Jehan, greatest of Mogul sovereigns,
who likewise built the Taj Mahal at Agra, one of the most beautiful
edifices ever designed by man. Abd-al-Hamid, of Lahore, in his Pâd-shâh-nâmah,
“Book of the King,” composed prior to 1654, writes as
follows:<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c017'><sup>[507]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c020'>In the course of years many valuable gems had come into the imperial
jewel house, each one of which might serve as an ear-drop for Venus or as an
adornment for the girdle of the Sun. Upon the accession of the emperor, it
occurred to him that, in the opinion of far-seeing men the acquisition of such
rare jewels and the keeping of such wonderful brilliants could render but one
service, that of adorning the throne of the empire. They ought, therefore, to
be put to such a use that beholders might benefit by their splendour and that
majesty might shine with increased brilliancy.</p>

<p class='c013'>As described by Tavernier in 1676, great quantities of pearls were
used in the ornamentation of this throne, the arched roof, the supporting
pillars, the adjacent sun-umbrellas, being well covered with these
gems, many of them of great value. The choicest one was pear-shaped,
yellowish in color, and weighed about fifty carats (200
grains);<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c017'><sup>[508]</sup></a> this was suspended from a great ruby which ornamented the
breast of the peacock. “But that which in my opinion is the most
costly thing about this magnificent throne is that the twelve columns
supporting the canopy are surrounded with beautiful rows of pearls,
which are round and of fine water, and weigh from 6 to 10 carats each
[24 to 40 grains].”<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c017'><sup>[509]</sup></a> The total value of the jewels entering into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>ornamentation was estimated at 160,500,000 livres or $60,187,500; and
the present value of the throne as it stands in the shah’s palace at
Teheran, whither it was carried by Nadir Shah from the sack of
Delhi in 1739, even though divested of many of its most valuable gems,
is estimated at $13,000,000.<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c017'><sup>[510]</sup></a> The designer of the Peacock Throne
was Austin de Bordeaux, who also planned the magnificent Taj
Mahal. He was named by Shah Jehan, “Jewel-Handed,” and received
a salary of two thousand rupees a month.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Shah’s “Tippet.”</span> Sir Harford Jones Brydges’ description of the
jewels of the Shah of Persia at Teheran is of particular value, since
he had formerly dealt in jewels and was an expert in such matters. He
says:</p>

<p class='c020'>I was particularly struck with the king’s tippet, a covering for part of his
back, his shoulders and his arms, which is only used on the very highest occasions.
It is a piece of pearl work of the most beautiful pattern; the pearls
are worked on velvet, but they stand so close together that little, if
any, of the velvet is visible. It took me a good hour to examine this single
article, which I have no fear of saying can not be matched in the world.
There was not a single pearl employed in forming this most gorgeous trapping
less in size than the largest marrow-fat pea I ever saw raised in England,
and many—I should suppose from 150 to 200—the size of a wild plum,
and throughout the whole of these pearls, it would puzzle the best jeweler
who should examine them most critically to discover in more than 4 or 5 a
serious fault. The tassel is formed of pearls of the most uncommon size and
beauty; and the emerald which forms the top of the tassel is perhaps the largest
perfect one in the world.... For some days after I had seen these jewels,
I  attempted to make an estimate of their value, but I got so confused in the
recollection of their weight and the allowance to be made in some of them for
their perfection in water and color, that I gave it up as impossible. I cannot,
however, think I shall much mislead if I say that on a moderate, perhaps a
low calculation, their value cannot be less than fifteen millions [sterling?] of
our money.<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c017'><sup>[511]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Shah’s Pearls in 1820.</span> Nearly a century ago the elaborate state
costume of the Shah of Persia was described by the English artist, Sir
Robert Ker Porter. In this description he mentioned particularly the
pearls in the tiara, the pear-shaped pearls of immense size with which
the plumes were tipped, the two strings of pearls—“probably the
largest in the world”—which crossed the king’s shoulders, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>large cushion incased in a network of beautiful pearls against which
he reclined.<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c017'><sup>[512]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pearls of the Gaikwar of Baroda.</span> Among the greatest jeweled
treasures of India are those of the present Mahratta Gaikwar of
Baroda, who has precedence over all the rulers in India at all functions,
and is one of the most prominent and enlightened of the Indian
princes. He governs a province of about 8225 square miles and
2,415,396 inhabitants in the northwestern part of India, 248 miles
north of Bombay. Most of these treasures, whose value is estimated
at a dozen million dollars, were collected by his predecessor, Mahratta
Khandarao, who lived in barbaric splendor, and they are rarely worn
by the present gaikwar. These treasures include a sash of one hundred
rows of pearls, terminating in a great tassel of pearls and emeralds;
seven rows of superb pearls whose value is estimated at half a
million dollars; a litter set with seed-pearls, quantities of unstrung
pearls, and more remarkable yet, a shawl or carpet of pearls, which
closely resembles the “tippet” at Teheran described by Brydge. This
carpet is said to be ten and one half feet long by six feet wide, and to
be made up of strings of pearls, except that a border, eleven inches
wide, and also center ornaments, are worked out in diamonds. Some
writers assert that this costly ornament was originally intended by the
late Mahratta Khandarao as a covering for the tomb of Mohammed.
Others state that it was designed as a present for a woman of whom
he was enamoured, but that the British resident interfered, claiming
that the wealth of Baroda was not sufficient to warrant such an expensive
gift on the part of the ruler. This ornament is now retained among
the regalia at Baroda, and is probably the most costly pearl ornament
in the world, its value being estimated at several million dollars.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Summer Palace in 1860.</span> Many superb pearls were among the precious
objects in the Yuen-Min-Yuen or Summer Palace in Pekin at
the time of its capture by the European forces in 1860. Numbers of
these were lost in the confusion of the sacking and plunder, when the
soldiers’ pockets were filled and the floors were strewn with jewels,
beautiful objects of gold and silver, rich silks and furs, carved jade,
lapis lazuli, etc. Some of the pearls found their way to Europe, and
especially to France and England. They were of good size and luster
and were mostly yellowish in color. Unfortunately, many were
crudely drilled with large holes, and had been strung on gold wires by
which they were attached to the idols they decorated at the time they
were stolen. More than one hundred, each over thirty grains in weight,
were received in England, and sold at an average of nearly one thousand
dollars.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>A similar booty came from the spoliation during the war between
China and Japan in 1894, and during the Boxer outbreaks of 1901,
and quantities of pearls, often large and of fine color, but a little the
worse for wear, were brought to the United States and Europe by the
soldiers and officials, and also by traders and travelers who obtained
them in China. The pendant figured is one of these objects.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>The Gogibus Pearl.</span> This famous pearl, said to have been the largest
in Europe, weighed no less than 126 carats (504 grains). It was
pear-shaped and of fine orient, and was brought from the West Indies,
in 1620, by François Gogibus, a native of Calais, who sold it to
Philip IV of Spain. As no match could be found for this magnificent
gem, it was mounted as a button in the royal cap.<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c017'><sup>[513]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>La Reine des Perles.</span> The large round pearl of the French crown
jewels which is listed in the inventory of 1791 at 200,000 francs, was
purchased in 1669<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c017'><sup>[514]</sup></a> for the sum of 40,000 livres, from a gem dealer
named Bazu, who had traveled in the East at about the time of Tavernier’s
voyage. In the inventory of 1691, it is described as “a virgin
pearl, perfect, round, and of fine water,” weighing 27½ carats and
valued at 90,000 livres. When the greater part of the jewels were
stolen from the Garde-Meuble in 1792, we are told that the thieves took
a pearl inclosed in a gold box on which was written: “The queen of
pearls.” This was most probably the one we have described and there
is reason to believe that this same pearl came later into the possession
of the Zozima brothers, and was called La Pellegrina.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>La Régente.</span> This name was bestowed upon a big, ovate pearl which
was in the collection of the French crown jewels. This pearl, which
weighs 337 grains, was furnished in November, 1811, by the court
jewelers, Messrs. Noitat, for a tiara, worn by Marie Louise, Empress
of France. By order of the emperor, Napoleon III, the pearl was
taken out of the tiara and mounted, in August, 1853, by the Paris
jeweler Lemounier into a brooch. This great brooch, with “La Régente”
as the central gem, was bought by Faberge &amp; Company of St.
Petersburg, Russia, for the Princess Youssoupoff at the “Vente des
Diamants de la Couronne” in 1887.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span><span class='sc'>La Pellegrina.</span> For nearly a century there has been in Russia one
of the most lovely pearls in the world; this is La Pellegrina, formerly
owned by the Zozima brothers of Moscow, who were antiquarians of
note in St. Petersburg. In 1818 a small book of forty-eight pages was
written about this beautiful gem by G. Fischer de Waldheim, vice-president
of the Imperial Medico-Chirurgical Academy, probably the
only book ever devoted to a single pearl. According to this writer, La
Pellegrina was purchased at Leghorn by one of the Zozima brothers
from an English admiral who had just returned from India. It combines
all the requisites of perfection: it is absolutely spherical and has
never been pierced; its luster, its silvery sheen, make it appear almost
transparent, and for a pearl of this high grade, it is of remarkable size,
weighing 111½ grains.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Zozima brothers retained it in a sea-urchin shell mounted in
gold and with a convex lens as cover; this was contained in a silver
box, and this in turn in another box studded with gems. Although
the lens enlarged the appearance of the pearl, it detracted from its
beautiful form, giving it an oval shape. But when removed from the
triple inclosure, it rolled about like a globule of quicksilver, and surpassed
that metal in whiteness and brilliancy.</p>

<p class='c020'>Everything that is beautiful and perfect takes such possession of the beholder
that words become insufficient to express his feelings; and that is what
happened to me in the case of La Pellegrina of Zozima. One must have seen
an object of this kind in order to appreciate the impression it makes. As an
evidence of this, I shall note the last visit which I made to the owner in company
with several distinguished persons.</p>

<p class='c020'>After having examined many curious medals and coins, and also some
pearls which exceeded in size the one of which I treat, and after they had
received their due meed of admiration, La Pellegrina appeared, rolled upon
a sheet of paper by the owner’s little finger. Attention and admiration was
depicted on every face; a perfect silence reigned. It was only when the pearl
had been removed very carefully lest it should slip away, and was again triply
enclosed, that we recovered the power of speech and could unanimously express
our admiration.<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c017'><sup>[515]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>As it had been stated that this pearl was in the possession of the
Princess Youssoupoff, Mr. Henry W. Hiller of New York, who was in St.
Petersburg, courteously made inquiries and was successful in obtaining
a view of the two splendid pear-shaped pearls. These are almost exactly
alike, but neither of them can well be La Pellegrina, since this is a
round pearl; possibly the one on the right may be La Peregrina.<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c017'><sup>[516]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>The owner of La Pellegrina in 1818, Z. P. Zozima, died in Moscow
at a great age, in 1827. He was a Greek dealer in curiosities and
gems, who had resided in Moscow for a long time, and had many
clients among the nobility of Russia. It is stated that a few months
before his death the best pieces of his collection, including La Pellegrina,
were stolen from him by a compatriot.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Moscow Pearl, 1840.</span> The German traveler, Johann Georg Kohl
(1808–1878), in the account of his travels in Russia, relates an interesting
incident connected with a beautiful pearl in the Imperial Treasury.
Shortly previous to 1840, a rich Moscow merchant died in a
convent, whither he had retreated after the manner of the wealthy
pious ones of his nation. Feeling the approach of age, he had given
up the toils of business to his sons. His wife was dead, and the only
beloved object which even in the cloister was not separated from him
was a large, beautiful, oriental pearl. This precious object had been
purchased for him by some Persian or Arabian friend at a high price,
and, enchanted by its water, magnificent size, and color, its perfect
shape and luster, he would never part with it, however enormous the
sum offered. He himself inhabited an ordinary cell in the convent;
but this object of his love reposed on silk in a golden casket. It was
shown to few persons, and favorable circumstances and strong recommendations
were necessary to obtain such a favor. A Moscow
resident reported the style and manner of the ceremony. On the appointed
day he went with his friends to the convent, and found the
old gentleman awaiting his guests in his holiday clothes. Their reception
had something of solemnity about it. The old man went into
his cell and brought out the casket in its rich covering. He spread
white satin on the table, and, unlocking the casket, let the precious
pearl roll out before the enchanted eyes of the spectators. No one
ventured to touch it, but all burst into acclamations, and the old man’s
eyes gleamed like his pearl. After a short time it was returned to the
casket. During his last illness, the old gentleman never let the pearl
out of his hand, and after his death it was with difficulty taken from
his stiffened fingers.</p>

<p class='c013'>There seems to be a great similarity between the description of this
pearl and that of La Pellegrina, although we have been unable to
verify our surmise as to their identity.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>The Hope Pearl.</span> In the first half of the last century, Henry Philip
Hope, a London banker, brought together a great collection of gems,
among which were many pearls. The most famous of these was the
often-described Hope pearl, one of the largest known; the value of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>which, however, is not in proportion to its size, owing to its irregular
formation. As described in the catalogue of the Hope collection,
published in 1839, this oriental pearl is of an irregular pear-shape,
weighs 1800 grains, or three ounces, measures two inches in length,
and in circumference four and one half inches at the broadest and
three and one fourth inches at the narrowest end. The color at the
larger end is of a bronze or a dark green copper tint, this gradually
clearing into a fine white luster for within one and one half inches of
the smaller end. This baroque pearl was firmly attached to the shell,
and it yet shows the point of attachment, which has been polished so
as to correspond to the remaining portion. It is attractively mounted,
the smaller end being capped with an arched crown of red enameled
gold set with diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c017'><sup>[517]</sup></a> After remaining in
the Hope jewel collection at the South Kensington Museum for many
years, it was sold at auction, at Christie’s, in 1886, when that collection
was placed on the market. This pearl is now held by Messrs.
Garrard &amp; Company of London, at the price of £9000.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Hope collection also contained about 148 pearls of good form.
Notable among these were the following: (a) a conical pearl weighing
151 grains, cream-white in color, from Polynesia; (b) a bouton
pearl of 124 grains, bluish-white at the top and encircled by a dark
bronze color; (c) an oval cream-colored pearl, weighing ninety-four
grains, from the South Seas; (d) an eighty-nine-grain, roughly
spherical pearl, one side bluish and the other of a light bronze; (e)
an eighty-five-grain, acorn-shaped, bluish-white pearl, with a band of
opaque white near the base; (f) an oval conch pearl, pink in general
color and somewhat whitish at the ends, weighing eighty-two and one
fourth grains; (g) another conch pearl, seventy-seven and one half
grains, button-shaped, yellowish white with a slight shade of pink;
(h) a seventy-six-and-one-half-grain drop-shaped pearl of a <i>chatoyant</i>
aspect, of white color shaded with red, purple, and green; and
(i) a pear-shaped Scottish pearl of thirty-four and three fourths
grains, of a milky bluish caste, slightly tinged with pink.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Van Buren Pearls.</span> Among the collections of the United States
National Museum are two pendant pearls each weighing about thirty
grains, and a necklace containing 148 pearls with an aggregate
weight of 700 grains. These were presented in 1840 to President
Van Buren by the Imam of Muscat. They were deposited in the
vaults of the Treasury Department, where they remained until a
few years ago, when, by the order of the Secretary of the Treasury,
they were transferred to the custody of the National Museum where
they now are.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Tiffany Queen Pearl.</span> Doubtless the most famous pearl ever
found within the limits of the United States, and likewise one of the
choicest, is the well-known “Queen Pearl,” found in Notch Brook near
Paterson, New Jersey, in 1857.<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c017'><sup>[518]</sup></a> In form it is a perfect sphere, and
weighs ninety-three grains. The history of the discovery and of the
sale of this beautiful gem is set forth on page 260.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>The Bapst Pearls.</span> Very practical is the account given by Streeter
of a pair of magnificent spherical pearls exhibited at the Paris Exhibition
in 1878 by Messrs. Bapst of Paris. One of these pearls—then
weighing 116 grains—was purchased by Mr. Streeter in 1877, and by
him sold to a leading merchant of London, who skilfully removed a
blemish on it, reducing it to 113¾ grains in weight. After holding it
for some months, it occurred to him that it would match a pearl sold
by Hunt and Roskell to Dhuleep Singh about fifteen years previously.
On comparison, the two were found to match perfectly, one weighing
113¾ and the other 113¼ grains. The two were eventually sold
early in 1878 “for £4800, which was even then much below their
value, and to-day they would be worth £10,000. They were exhibited
in the great Paris Exposition in 1878, where they attracted universal
attention, and were pronounced by connoisseurs to be the most extraordinary
pair of pearls ever seen in Europe. They were sold from
the exhibition to an individual for a very large sum.”<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c017'><sup>[519]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span><span class='sc'>The “Southern Cross.”</span> The “Southern Cross” is an unusual pearl
or rather cluster of pearls which attracted much attention twenty
years ago. It consists of nine attached pearls forming a Roman cross
about one and one half inches in length, seven pearls constituting
the shaft or standard, while the arms are formed by one pearl on each
side of the second one from the upper end. The luster is good, but
the individual pearls are not perfect spheres, being mutually compressed
at the point of juncture and considerably flattened at the
back. If separated, the aggregate value of the individual pearls
would be small, and the celebrity of the ornament is due almost exclusively
to its form. This striking formation was exhibited at the Colonial
and Indian Exhibition at London in 1886, and later at the Paris
Exhibition in 1889, where it was the center of interest, and obtained
a gold medal for the exhibitors. It is reported that an effort was
made to bring about its sale at £10,000, the owners suggesting that it
was especially appropriate for presentation to Leo XIII, on the occasion
of his jubilee in 1896. The writers have been unable to obtain
information as to its present location.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much information relative to the “Southern Cross” was volunteered
by Henry Taunton in the very interesting account of his wanderings
in Australia. He presents apparently reliable statements
showing that it was found on March 26, 1883, off Baldwin Creek in
Lat. 17° S. and Long. 122° E., by a boy named Clark, in the employ
of James W. S. Kelly, a master pearler. When delivered to Kelly, it
was in three distinct pieces, but the boy reported that it was in one
piece when he found it a few hours before. Kelly sold it in the three
pieces in which he received it for £10 to a fellow pearler named Roy;
Roy sold it for £40 to a man named Craig, and he sold it to an Australian
syndicate.</p>

<p class='c013'>However, according to Taunton’s positive statement, there were
only eight pearls in the cluster when it was sold by Kelly in 1883, and
to make it resemble a well-proportioned cross—the right arm being
absent—another pearl of suitable size and shape was subsequently
secured at Cossack and attached in the proper place to the others,
which, in the meantime, had been refastened together by diamond
cement, thus making three artificial joints in the present cluster. “As
if to assist in the deception, nature had fashioned a hollow in the side
of the central pearl just where the added pearl would have to be fitted;
and—the whole pearling fleet with their pearls and shells coming into
Cossack about this time—it was no difficult matter to select a pearl of
the right size and with the convexity required. The holder paid some
ten or twelve pounds for the option of selecting a pearl within given
limits; and then once more, with the aid of diamond cement and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>of a skilful ‘faker,’ this celebrated gem was transformed into a perfect
cross.”<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c017'><sup>[520]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Morgan-Tiffany Collection.</span> Probably the most interesting assortment
of American pearls is the Morgan-Tiffany Collection in the
American Museum of Natural History, New York. The excellence
of this collection lies, not in the high cost of any individual pearl, but
in its illustrating in a comprehensive manner the great variety, colors,
and forms of American pearls. Not only are the many varieties of
fresh-water pearls represented, but likewise abalone pearls from the
Pacific coast, conch pearls from the Gulf of Mexico, and a good assortment
of pearly concretions from edible oysters and clams of the
Atlantic coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>This collection contains 557 species of white and colored Unio
pearls, four multicolored, five mallet-shapes, 166 baroques, thirty-nine
hinge pearls, twenty pearlaceous masses, thirty-four clam
(Venus) pearls, fifteen abalone pearls, eleven conch pearls, and twelve
oyster (Ostrea) pearls. The collection was exhibited in two parts,
the first at the Paris Exposition of 1889, and the second at the Paris
Exposition of 1900. On each occasion a gold medal was awarded.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Count Batthyani’s Pearl.</span> A curious history is connected with a
beautiful black pearl<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c017'><sup>[521]</sup></a> which was at one time in the possession of
Count Louis Batthyani, the premier of the revolutionary government
of Hungary. The count was shot in 1849, by the orders of a court-martial,
and on the eve of his execution he gave the pearl, which he
had worn mounted on a scarf-pin, to his trusty and faithful valet.
The latter left it to his son, who, when in straightened circumstances,
sought to raise money upon the pearl. The pawnbroker of the small
town was distrustful of its value and took it to Budapest for appraisal.
There the suspicions of the authorities were aroused, an investigation
was ordered, and it was finally discovered that the pearl
had been stolen one hundred and fifty years before from the English
crown. The English government redeemed it for the sum of £2500
($12,500). How it came into the possession of Count Batthyani is a
mystery; probably he purchased it from some antiquarian.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1900 there was shown in Paris one of the most important black
pearls of any time, a pear-shaped pearl of forty-nine grains, of a most
wonderful black color with a green sheen, as perfectly formed
as though it had been turned out of a lathe; it did not terminate in a
point at the small end, but was slightly flattened. It was so beautiful
an object that it almost seemed it should never be drilled for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>mounting. This pearl ultimately sold for more than $30,000, and it is
probably the finest black pearl that has ever reached the European
markets.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to a personal communication from E. Z. Steever, governor
of the District of Sulu, the largest pearl that he has seen in the
islands belongs to the sultan, and is now in the possession of Hadji
Butu, former prime minister. It is an oblate spheroid, there being a
trifling difference between the two diameters. The upper hemisphere
is very beautiful; the lower one has a few minute, black specks which
are superficial and could be easily removed, the pearl not having been
treated since it was taken from the oyster. This pearl measures
five eighths of an inch at its greatest diameter and is said to weigh
twelve carats (forty-eight grains). Hadji Butu informed Governor
Steever that the sultan had refused $25,000 for the pearl in Singapore.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Nordica pearl is the finest abalone of which we have any record.
It weighs 175 grains, is a drop pearl of a greenish hue, with brilliant
red fire-like flashes, and serves as a pendant to the famous collection
of colored pearls belonging to the beloved and admired American
prima donna, Madam Nordica.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the International Exposition in Paris in 1889, Mr. Alphonse
Falco, president of the Chambre Syndicale, exhibited a round pearl,
white and lustrous, weighing seventy grains, and valued at 50,000
francs.</p>

<p class='c013'>Augusto Castellani, the well-known Italian jeweler of Rome, in the
year 1868, during the Papal regime, executed a crown for King Victor
Emmanuel II. This crown was destined for the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre, in Jerusalem, and on it is a pearl which, although
slightly irregular, is as large as the famous Gogibus pearl.</p>

<p class='c013'>A remarkable golden-yellow pearl from Shark’s Bay, West
Australia, is in the possession of a New York lady; it weighs thirty
and one half grains, is perfectly round, and is without a flaw or blemish.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Crown Jewels of France.</span> The collection of gems known as the
Crown Jewels of France owed its origin to Francis I (1494–1547).
While in Bordeaux, on his way to meet his bride, Eleanor of Austria,
sister of Emperor Charles V, Francis created by letter patent the
Treasure of the Crown Jewels, giving to the state a number of his
most valued diamonds, under the condition that at each change of
sovereign a careful inventory should be made. The original collection
consisted of six pieces of jewelry valued at 272,242 “<i>écus soleil</i>,”
or about $700,000. The crown jewels have passed through many vicissitudes
in the course of time. A number of the gems were at various
times pledged as security for loans made in France and Italy, and it is
said that in 1588, during the reign of Henry III, all the jewels disappeared
from the royal treasury. Henry IV strove to regather the
scattered ornaments, but it was only in the reign of Louis XIV that
the collection became really important. At the time of the French
Revolution, in 1791, an inventory was made by the order of the National
Assembly.</p>

<p>THE MADAM NORDICA COLLECTION OF COLORED PEARLS<br /><br />The Nordica drop pearl weighs 175 grains</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>The jewels were then deposited in the Garde-Meuble, where they
were exposed to public view. Either they were very carelessly
guarded, or the guardians were in collusion with a band of thieves,
for the room wherein they were kept was entered on five successive
nights, and when the theft was finally discovered only about 500,000
francs’ ($100,000) worth of the gems remained. Many of the most
valuable objects were, however, traced and recovered. Napoleon I,
when he became emperor, made every effort to enrich the treasure,
and purchased gems to the value of 6,000,000 francs ($1,200,000),
and subsequent rulers added to the collection on various occasions.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the time of the official inventory in 1791 the entire collection of
pearls was estimated at about 1,000,000 francs ($200,000). The finest
specimen in the collection was a splendid round pearl weighing
109¼ grains<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c017'><sup>[522]</sup></a> and estimated at 200,000 francs ($40,000), or $366 per
grain, on a base of $3.35. Then came two pear-shaped pearls of a
fine orient and well-matched, weighing respectively 117¾ and 113
grains, and valued at 300,000 francs ($60,000) or $260 per grain, on
a base of $2.25. In addition to the above there were twenty-five separate
round pearls which had constituted the necklace of the queen; they
ranged in weight from 36 to 165½ grains, and were valued at about
90,000 francs ($18,000). Beside the pear-shaped pearls to which we
have alluded, there were two other pairs, each valued at 32,000 francs
($6400) for the two pearls; they averaged about 100 grains in
weight. In addition to these there were two weighing respectively
175½ and 205¼ grains, each valued at 20,000 francs ($4000), and
seven others ranging in weight from 92½ to 167 grains and valued
at from 10,000 to 15,000 francs ($2000 to $3000). The best oval
pearl was one weighing seventy-six and one half grains and estimated
at 20,000 francs ($4000); there were two others, one of
ninety-three grains, valued at 12,000 francs ($2400), and one of 121
grains, valued at 10,000 francs ($2000). We may also mention an
egg-shaped pearl weighing 145¼ grains, estimated as worth 10,000
francs ($2000), and a button pearl of 198 grains entered at 15,000
francs ($3000). Beside these separate pearls there were eleven
strings comprising 310 pearls, weighing in all 6778 grains and valued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>at but 29,400 francs (about $6000). The average per pearl was 95
francs ($19), less than one dollar a grain.</p>

<p class='c013'>These pearls, according to their beauty, would now be worth from
four to six times the valuation here given, so that the two large pear-shaped
pearls of the French crown may be worth to-day $200,000 and
the great round pearl from $100,000 to $250,000.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many of these pearls were a century old. They were collected at a
time when not as much attention was paid to their absolute perfection
and beauty as at the present time, for there probably never has
been a period when rare and perfect pearls, diamonds, or rubies have
been appreciated so much more highly than those of mediocre quality.</p>

<p>GRAND PEARL DIADEM OF THE FRENCH CROWN JEWELS<br /><br />Containing 212 pearls weighing 2452 grains, and 1990 diamonds weighing 74 27–32 carats. Worn by the Empress Eugénie</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>After the downfall of Napoleon III and the proclamation of the
French Republic, the jewels were inventoried, and, by a law passed
December 10, 1886, it was decreed that a large part of the treasure
should be sold at public auction. The sale was held in the Pavilion de
Flore, a part of the Palace of the Tuileries, on May 12, 1887, and, very
naturally, all the principal gem dealers and collectors were represented.
A number of remarkable pearl ornaments were among the objects
offered at this sale, one of the most beautiful being a diadem of an
exceptionally artistic openwork design, adorned with large, round
pearls and surmounted by a row of magnificent pear-shaped pearls.
The total number of pearls in this diadem was 212, and their weight
2452 grains. It was sold for the sum of 78,000 francs ($15,600).
The coronet which accompanied the diadem comprised 274 pearls,
weighing 984 grains; the design was similar to that of the diadem,
but the points consisted of a round and a pear-shaped pearl in alternation.
This ornament realized the sum of 30,000 francs ($6000).
A large brooch of very elaborate and beautiful design, beside a number
of smaller pearls, comprised four fine, pear-shaped pendants,
weighing 100 grains each, and two choice bouton pearls, and had in
the center the famous pearl known as “La Régente,” which was purchased
in 1811 for 40,000 francs ($8000). This splendid ornament
brought the sum of 176,000 francs ($35,200). Four other brooches
each contained seven pearls and many brilliants, the twenty-eight
pearls having a total weight of 1496 grains, an average of more than
fifty-three grains. Each brooch had two pearls surrounded with brilliants,
and five large, pear-shaped pearls set as pendants. They were
sold to different purchasers at prices ranging from 18,500 francs
($3700) to 43,000 francs ($8600), the four together realizing 113,500
francs ($22,700).</p>

<p class='c013'>Six pearl necklaces were also offered. One of forty-seven pearls
weighing 698 grains was sold for 34,600 francs ($6920), and two
others, each consisting of fifty-eight pearls, with a total weight of
524 and 400 grains respectively, brought the sum of 22,300 francs
($4460) and 15,000 francs ($3000). Another necklace composed of
thirty-eight round pearls and nine pear-shaped pendants, the total
weight being 1612 grains, sold for 74,300 francs ($14,860). The two
finest necklaces were broken up into a number of separate lots. One
of them, consisting of 362 pearls and weighing in all 5808 grains,—an
average of a trifle over sixteen grains,—was offered in four lots
which together brought 295,800 francs ($59,160). The other necklace
comprised 542 pearls weighing 6752 grains, and was disposed of in
eight lots, realizing in all 331,800 francs ($66,360). Two bracelets
adorned with 202 pearls and a number of small brilliants were purchased
for the sum of 90,200 francs ($18,040). The total amount realized
for the pearl ornaments was 1,261,500 francs ($252,300). There
are several American ladies who own single strings of pearls which are
of more value than the whole pearl parure of the Empress Eugénie.</p>

<p class='c018'>The pearls in the cross surmounting the crown have a weight of
thirty-six grains.</p>

<p class='c013'>The imperial cross is profusely ornamented with pearls in front,
while the back consists simply of silver-gilt. There are three strings
of pearls in the front running in each direction. The total weight of
the pearls is 4092 grains; one weighing sixty-four grains, and the
smallest two grains.</p>

<p class='c013'>The crucifix of the Golden Fleece is ornamented only in front with
pearls; these have a weight of but 136 grains.</p>

<p class='c013'>The imperial Austrian regalia, dating from the time of Emperor
Rudolph II, are also in the imperial Burg; some of the emperor’s
jewels were sold at auction in Prague in 1728.</p>

<p class='c013'>The crown is adorned with two rows of pearls, weighing respectively
960 and 840 grains; between these rows are pearls having a total
weight of 440 grains, while the ornaments and eight large drops
weigh 2052 grains. The largest pearl on this crown weighs 104
grains. It is drop-shaped and belonged to Rudolph II; it is slightly
uneven and the color, although white, is not that of a new pearl, but
this pearl has a positive history of three hundred and six years, and
at the present time is probably the oldest known unchanged pearl with
a direct and authentic record.</p>

<p class='c013'>The imperial orb is studded with pearls weighing in all 1560
grains. Four of these weigh forty grains each, the others are of lesser
size, the smallest weighing ten grains. The scepter is adorned with
pearls to the weight of 300 grains.</p>

<p class='c013'>In addition to these insignia and regalia there are in the treasury
two magnificent pearl necklaces, deposited by Empress Maria Theresa
in 1765. The first consists of a single string of 114 large-sized pearls
with the “Baden Solitaire,” a diamond of 30 carats, as a clasp. Three
of these pearls weigh from 92 to 100 grains each, and the whole
string has a total weight of 3400 grains. This would give us the

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>The total weight of the pearls in all these ornaments is 35,816

<p class='c013'>The so-called crown of Charlemagne bears the inscription: “Chuonradus
Rex Dei gratia Romanorum Imperator Aug.” It is believed
to be a work of the twelfth century and originally the royal crown of
Conrad III, king of the Germans (1093–1152), the first Hohenstaufen.<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c017'><sup>[524]</sup></a>
The arch is said to have been added to adapt this royal crown
for use in the expected coronation of Conrad as emperor. He died,
however, while making preparations for his journey to Rome.</p>

<p class='c013'>The imperial vestments used in the coronation ceremonies of the
Holy Roman Empire, were produced in the celebrated Hôtel de Tirâz,
at Palermo. Roger II, King of Sicily (1096–1154), after a victorious
campaign in Greece, brought back with him to Sicily a number of
skilled silk-weavers and embroiderers, whom he established at Palermo.
The imperial mantle is of a brilliant purple and bears an inscription,
embroidered in gold and pearls, stating that the garment
was made in the royal manufactory in the year 1133. Two pearl-embroidered
representations of a lion, who has stricken down a camel and
is about to tear it to pieces, also appear on this mantle. This symbol
of royal power was used frequently by the Saracens, and it is said that
Richard Cœur de Lion had this design embroidered on his saddlecloths.<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c017'><sup>[525]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A fine collection of large baroque pearls is preserved in the Grüne
Gewölbe (Green Vaults) in the palace at Dresden, which contains the
treasures of the royal family of Saxony. Most of these were mounted
during the eighteenth century by J. M. Dinglinger (1665–1731), the
famous goldsmith to the Saxon Elector, King Augustus II of Poland,
and who is sometimes called the German Cellini. A splendid specimen
of his work is a vase of Egyptian jasper in the shape of a shell, bearing
a representation of Hercules fighting with the Nemæan lion; this
bears reference to the immense personal strength and power of
Augustus II, whose portrait is painted in enamel on a mirror at the
back. The pedestal is adorned with a great many precious stones,
pearls, and enamel paintings in the shape of cameos representing the
twelve labors of Hercules. A dragon is studded with emeralds and
its back is formed of pearls, with a large sardonyx in the middle. Hercules
and the lion are in enamel.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the same collection may be seen the figure of a dwarf made
by Ferbecq, who was one of the goldsmiths of King Augustus. The
body of the dwarf is formed of a baroque pearl, which is studded
with small diamonds. His sleeves and trousers are in black and
green enamel; his hat is also of green enamel and on it is a string
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>of diamonds. In his right hand the dwarf holds a spit and in his left
a roast. On his left shoulder he bears a goose, the upper part of
whose body is formed of a pearl; at his right side hangs a bottle also
formed of a pearl. The gilded pedestal is ornamented with white
enamel work on a pink ground. Above and below, it is set with white
and yellow diamonds. Another figure, similarly formed of a large
baroque pearl ornamented with gold and diamonds, shows a drunken
vintager and his dog; and an exceedingly grotesque, ornamented
baroque is said to bear a striking resemblance to Señor Pepe, the
court dwarf of Charles II of Spain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Exhibited at the Palace of Rosenberg at Copenhagen, are similar
designs in which large baroques form the principal part of fish, birds,
dragons, mermaids, etc. Prominent among them is the figure of a
skater, executed by the jeweler, Diederichsen; it is said that this was
made for Frederick VII, who died before it was accepted, and in 1895
it was presented to the museum.</p>

<p class='c013'>A beautiful and costly figure of this nature was completed a year or
two ago by the court jeweler, Alfred Dragsen, of Copenhagen. This
is nearly four inches in height, and represents a female snake-charmer.
A very long baroque pearl forms the body from the shoulders to the
knees, and the head, arms, and the legs below the knees are of gold.
The figure is ornamented with a diamond-studded garland, ruby necklace
and earrings, and garters set with similar gems, a red enameled
girdle ornamented with pearls, and golden anklets with black pearls.
With a flute she charms a serpent twined about her body and grasped
with the other hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>What is said to be the finest collection of black pearls in all Europe
is that belonging to the Duchess of Anhalt Dessau, Germany. It
consists of three large caskets of black pearls that have taken a century
to collect. It is traditional in the family that these pearls are
never to be sold except as their last possession, since they know they
will always find a purchaser.</p>

<p class='c013'>A collection of pearls had been kept for many years in the Monte
de Piedad of Mexico City, which it was claimed had been pawned by
a friend of the Empress Carlotta, in order to provide her with money
at the time of the assassination of Emperor Maximilian. These pearls
were contained in a necklace and a pearl and diamond tiara, which
were sewn upon cardboard covered with black velvet, and had the appearance
of not having been disturbed for many years. The necklace
consisted of old pearls, both of the so-called Madras and Panama
varieties; in the center was a large diamond medallion from which
pear-shaped pearls were suspended. It is believed that these pearls
were part of Empress Carlotta’s marriage portion, and that they
came from the Austrian crown jewel collection. None of them possessed
much quality with the exception of one, a large pear-shaped
pearl which was set at the base of the necklace and weighed eighty-four
grains. The drilling of this pearl was of a very old style, being
of that type in which a tube is inserted in the drill hole, through which
a gold wire passes to hold the pearl; a diamond is then set at the base
of the tube to disguise the drill mark. It is, however, possible that
the pearl came from the East Indies, where large drill holes are usual.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>The pearls were sent in bond to the United States as a collection,
and then to Europe, where they were sold separately, the pear-shaped
pearl appearing again in the New York market in 1906. There has
been some doubt as to these really being Carlotta’s pearls, but the
Mexican account is fairly consistent, and it satisfactorily disposes of
the newspaper romance in which it was claimed that Carlotta had
taken these pearls with her to Europe and that they had been buried
in a casket in the Adriatic Sea.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Recent Auction Sales.</span> In England and in France, more than in
the United States, great auction sales of jewels are common. They are
held in London, principally at Christie’s, originally a coffee house,
established in 1880; and in Paris, at the Hôtel Drouot. Good prices are
generally realized, as the buyers of the entire continent attend these
great sales. The purchases are usually made by dealers who frequently
do not neglect each other’s interests if private buyers are present.
No matter how great may be the amount involved, no matter
whether the collections consist of paintings, furniture, or jewels,
there are always buyers, to a much greater extent than in the United
States. The price for fine jewels may naturally vary a trifle in the
different markets, according to the conditions of payment. It must
evidently make an appreciable difference whether almost the entire
amount is paid in cash or whether a credit of thirty days is extended,
or one for a much longer period, in some countries for as long as
one, two, or even three years.</p>

<p class='c013'>While in the United States such sales of valuable jewels are very
unusual, it has been a custom in England and in France for many
years, in the settlement of estates, to sell not only the furniture, bric-à-brac,
etc., but also the jewels. Sales of this kind are naturally calculated
to attract not only the dealers, but also many rich collectors and
connoisseurs, and as they are frequently widely advertised, and London
and Paris are, at the most, but one to two days’ journey from all
parts of Europe, many people attend, most of the private buyers being
represented by their agents. By means of these sales many heirlooms,
which have been handed down from generation to generation, often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>pass into the possession of strangers. In the matter of jewels, it has
been frequently noticed that dealers are in the majority of cases the
ultimate buyers, and it has also been inferred that when an outsider
participates in the bidding, the prices are advanced to such an extent
that it does not often appear profitable for him to buy in the face of
such competition. All manner of people have had their estates disposed
of in this way, and the list of these sales during the past twenty years
is a striking one: royalty, nobility, merchants, and people in many other
conditions of life find a place in it.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not an infrequent custom in London for solicitors to advance
money on jewels, and when the payments are not forthcoming these
jewels are sold. Hence, many sales appear at the larger auction
rooms in which no name is given, the owners frequently being people
of high degree.</p>

<p class='c020'>On July 19, 1892, a necklace containing eighty-five graduated pearls of unusual
size and quality, the property of the late H. W. F. Bolchow, M.P., was
sold in London for the sum of £2500 ($12,500). Another necklace of 146
fine graduated pearls disposed in two rows, brought £2400 ($12,000); a single-row
necklace of eighty-five pearls realized £1600 ($8000), and one of 118
pearls in two rows £1660 ($8300).</p>

<p class='c020'>An exceptionally fine pearl necklace which belonged to her Grace the late
Caroline, Duchess of Montrose, mother of the present Duke of Montrose,
was sold at Christie’s on April 30, 1895. The necklace comprised 362 graduated
pearls, arranged in seven rows of forty-four, forty-seven, forty-eight,
forty-nine, fifty-two, fifty-eight, and sixty-four pearls, respectively. The
amount realized for this ornament was £11,500 ($57,500).</p>

<p class='c020'>On July 9, 1901, a pearl necklace, advertised as the property of “a French
lady of rank,” and several other valuable pearl ornaments, were offered at
Christie’s. It is supposed by many that these jewels belonged to Madame
Humbert. The necklace was composed of six rows of graduated pearls consisting
of fifty-five, sixty-one, sixty-seven, seventy-three, seventy-nine, and
eighty-nine pearls, respectively, a total of 424, all of good color and luster.
A London dealer considers that they owed their value mainly to skilful matching
and fineness of color; they are perhaps a century old. As may be supposed,
there were many bidders who competed eagerly for possession of this
fine ornament, and it was at last adjudged for the sum of £20,000 ($100,000).
While this was, up to that date, a record price in an auction room, it was by
no means an exceptional figure for private sales; indeed, at about the time
this necklace was sold, a London dealer disposed of another for £34,000
($170,000).</p>

<p class='c020'>A necklace, the property of the late Lady Matheson of the Lews, was sold
at Christie’s, March 5, 1902. Well-matched and graduated round pearls, to
the number of 233, were disposed in four rows, and strung with seed-pearls
between. This necklace, which had been presented to Lady Matheson at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>time of her marriage in 1843 by Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, Bart., brought the
sum of £6800 ($34,000).</p>

<p class='c020'>A pearl necklace, containing fifty-three fine and graduated pearls, was sold
in London, June 9, 1902, for the sum of £2250 ($11,250). Another necklace
of sixty-eight fine round pearls, one of which formed the clasp, brought £1580
($7900). A beautiful pearl and brilliant pendant of open scroll design, with
a large, round white pearl in the center, and a large, pear-shaped black pearl
as drop, realized £800 ($4000), and a pearl collar of ten rows of round pearls
brought £820 ($4100). A noteworthy offering at this sale was a rope of 135
pearls, an heirloom sold under the will of Lady Marianna Augusta Hamilton.
These pearls had been given to Lady Augusta Anne Cockburn in 1769 on the
occasion of her marriage to Sir James Cockburn, Bart., by her godmother,
Augusta, Duchess of Brunswick, sister to George III. The rope was sold for
£900 ($4500).</p>

<p class='c020'>The pearls of Lady Dudley were sold at Christie’s on July 4, 1902. Among
them was a magnificent necklace of forty-seven slightly graduated round
pearls, of large size and unusually brilliant orient; their gross weight was 1090
grains. This necklace brought the sum of £22,200 ($111,000). A single
pear-shaped pearl of the finest orient mounted with a diamond cap, as a pendant,
and weighing 209 grains, was sold for £13,500 ($67,500). A rope of
222 graduated round pearls of the highest quality, weighing 2320 grains was
purchased for £16,700 ($83,500), and a pearl and brilliant tiara brought
£10,300 ($51,500). The entire casket of thirty-one lots realized £89,526
($447,630).</p>

<p class='c020'>At the sale of the jewels of Mlle. Wanda de Boncza, at the Hôtel Drouot,
Paris, December 6, 1902, a fine necklace was disposed of for the sum of
150,000 francs ($30,000), and a rope of 100 small pearls realized 38,100
francs ($7620); the proceeds of the entire sale of these jewels were 1,249,578
francs ($249,915).</p>

<p class='c020'>Among the Aqualia jewels, sold in London in 1903, was a pearl necklace
that brought £4480 ($22,400).</p>

<p class='c020'>The jewels of the late Marquis of Anglesey, an enthusiastic jewel and art
collector, were disposed of at Christie’s on May 4 and 5, 1904. At the time of
his death, the marquis was supposed to be a bankrupt, but the value of the
gems which he had purchased had increased so rapidly that the sale realized
the sum of £22,988 10s. ($114,942), more than enough to cover all the obligations
of the estate. Of this amount a magnificent drop pearl, mounted as
a scarf-pin, brought £4000 ($20,000); another drop pearl of the finest orient,
weighing 105½ grains, but slightly cracked, was sold for £3700 ($18,500).
Four other drop-shaped pearls, mounted as scarf-pins, were sold for £5220
($26,100), one of them bringing £1720 ($8600). A single bouton pearl, used
as a coat fastener, realized £980 ($4900), and a pearl trefoil was purchased
for £580 ($2900). One fine large bouton pearl, set as a stud, was disposed of
for £3000 ($15,000), and another somewhat smaller bouton, also set as a
stud, brought £1600 ($8000).</p>

<p class='c020'>A splendid necklace comprising forty-nine well-matched and graduated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>pearls of fine quality, weighing 563½ grains, was sold in London on June 29,
1905,  for the sum of £4700 ($23,500). At the same sale a necklace of thirty-two
graduated pearls, weighing about 890 grains, brought £2600 ($13,000).</p>

<p class='c020'>On July 20, 1905, a pearl necklace comprising forty-five graduated pearls
of fine orient, with a cabochon ruby clasp, the gross weight being 832 grains,
was sold in London for £3150 ($15,750).</p>

<p class='c020'>A fine pearl and brilliant pendant was disposed of at the sale in London,
February 21, 1906, of the stock of Mr. E. M. Marcoso. This pendant was
composed of one large white brilliant, weighing 18<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>32</sub> carats, and a drop-shaped
pearl weighing 75¾ grains. The ornament brought the sum of £2050
($10,250).</p>

<p class='c020'>A pearl necklace composed of 285 well-matched and graduated pearls disposed
in five rows was sold in London on June 13, 1906, for the sum of
£10,000 ($50,000). At the same sale a three-row necklace, with 213 graduated
and matched pearls of fine orient, brought £3200 ($16,000), and a rope of 237
fine pearls realized £2800 ($14,000).</p>

<p class='c020'>Among the jewels disposed of at a sale in London on July 11, 1906, may be
mentioned a five-row pearl necklace of 445 graduated oriental pearls which
was sold for £2500 ($12,500). Three other necklaces were offered at the
same sale; one of fifty-five matched and graduated pearls of fine quality bringing
£3400 ($17,000); one of fifty-seven pearls, £2700 ($13,500), and the
other of 219 well-matched and graduated pearls realizing £2350 ($11,750).
Still another necklace of 417 matched and graduated pearls arranged in five
rows was sold for £4800 ($24,000). A splendid pearl drop, of the finest orient,
brought £1650 ($8250), and a pearl rope of 191 oriental pearls, arranged so
as to form three single-row necklaces, realized the sum of £3700 ($18,500),
three fine black pearls, mounted as studs, were sold for £1000 ($5000). The
most important necklace was reserved for the end of the sale; this was composed
of forty-seven large oriental pearls, and was purchased for the sum of
£10,000 ($50,000).</p>

<p class='c020'>At the sale of the Massey-Mainwaring collection at Christie’s on March 18,
1907, a five-row pearl necklace consisting of 471 graduated pearls, with a
bouton pearl in the center, was sold for £4600 ($23,000).</p>

<p class='c020'>Another collection, sold at Christie’s, April 15, 1907, was the property of
the late Mrs. Lewis-Hill, and the proceeds of the first day’s sale reached the
heretofore unapproached total of £94,805 ($474,025), thus exceeding by
$26,395 the amount obtained in one day by the sale of Lady Dudley’s jewels.
Among the valuable pearls in this collection, we may mention a pair of large
bouton pearl earrings, with small diamond tops, which brought £1180
($5900). The enthusiasm and interest of the assembly were aroused by a
necklace of forty-five large, graduated pearls of fine orient, with a bouton
pearl and brilliant cluster snap; after spirited bidding this was bought for
£6100 ($30,500). The greatest event of the day, however, was the appearance
of a splendid rope of 229 pearls of very good form, well-matched and
graduated. The opening bid was £10,000 ($50,000) and after a warm contest
the pearls were finally acquired for the sum of £16,700 ($83,500). A
necklace consisting of fifteen graduated drops, each formed of one bouton
pearl, one brilliant, and one pear-shaped pearl drop, depending from a narrow
band of small diamonds, drew forth a bid of £5000 ($25,000) and was finally awarded
for the sum of £12,200 ($61,000). A pearl rope of 183 graduated
and well-matched pearls realized £7200 ($36,000), and a fine pair of pearls set
as earrings brought £3400 ($17,000). The crowded auction room, the keen
competition among the bidders, and the amount obtained for these jewels are
good indications of the firmness of the market at the present time.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>At the sale of the jewels of Lady Henry Gordon-Lennox, held at Christie’s
on May 12, 1907, a splendid necklace was offered. It comprised 287 graduated
pearls of the finest orient, disposed in five rows, with a large circular pearl.
This magnificent ornament was sold for £25,500 ($127,500).</p>

<p class='c020'>On July 11, 1907, a splendid necklace of forty-nine graduated pearls, of
fine luster and carefully matched, was sold at auction by Debenham and Storr
of London, for the sum of £5600 ($28,000). At the same sale a single-row
necklace of forty-five pearls brought £5300 ($26,500), and a rope of oriental
pearls realized £4500 ($22,500).</p>

<p class='c020'>At the auction sale of the collection of the late Bishop Bubics of Hungary,
among other objects, a very handsome saber pouch was offered, of the style
worn by the Hungarian hussars. It was of green silk and richly embroidered
with hundreds of pearls of varying sizes. After a spirited competition this
pouch was sold to Prince Esterhazy for 13,500 crowns ($2700). Some time
after the sale a letter from the late bishop was found, containing the statement
that he had borrowed the ornament from the jewel-room of the Princess Esterhazy.
Naturally, Prince Esterhazy was not called upon to pay the amount
of his bid. It is a gratification to know that at least one of the remarkable
Magyar jeweled ornaments has escaped the cupidity of enterprising jewelers
who have broken up so many of these ornaments for the gems which they
contained.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>XVII<br /> <span class='large'>THE ABORIGINAL USE OF PEARLS, AND THEIR DISCOVERY IN MOUNDS AND GRAVES</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c027'>The use of pearls by the aborigines of the territory now comprised
in the United States is proven by their appearance in
the mounds and certain graves of pre-Columbian date. This
is of great interest in view of the unique system of burial and
the great variety of objects buried with the pearls. It is evident from
the quantities discovered in some of the mounds that a very great
number of pearls, many of large size, must have been owned by these
aborigines, and they were evidently quite expert in the art of drilling
them. Pearls must have been freely used for ornamental purposes,
and it is clear that many rivers in this region must have produced them
in great numbers, when we consider that in all probability the mussels
were taken only as they were required for food or for bait in fishing,
and had probably reached their full growth.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not unlikely that pearls were used on this continent for a long
period, and they may have been in use centuries before any employment
was made of them in Europe. In the age of the mound-builders
there were as many pearls in the possession of a single tribe of Indians
as existed in any European court. We have no means of ascertaining
the precise date of any of these burials, and there are no historical
records relating to this region, such as were kept in Mexico as well as
in Europe and Asia. No trace has been found of the employment of
pearls, either for decoration or ornament, by the aborigines of Europe
or Asia; either they did not use them or else the pearls have entirely
passed away in the course of twenty or more centuries. We do know,
however, that neither pearls nor Unio shells were used by any of the
lake-dwellers of Switzerland or the adjacent countries.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many eminent archæologists have investigated the finding and history
of the pearls of the mound-builders of Ohio and Alabama, especially
Squier and Davis, F. W. Putnam, Warren K. Moorehead, C.
C. Jones, W. C. Mills, and Clarence B. Moore. The discoveries made
up to 1890 were fully treated by one of the writers in several pamphlets
(one of them, “Gems and Precious Stones of North America”).</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>It is not unlikely that the Indians of the Atlantic coast may have
known of pearls from the common clam as well as from the edible
oyster. The former may have often contained pearls weighing from
fifty to one hundred grains each, as at that period the mollusks were
permitted to attain their full growth, and perhaps were not eaten except
when they were as small as little-neck clams; the larger ones were
sought for the purple spot which held the muscle, and was used for
wampum. We have no record of the finding of pearls in any graves
north of Virginia, as the many graves opened in the past century have
failed to reveal them, nor has the use of pearls been mentioned by any
of the early writers. They may have been worn, but if so they have
passed away or may have been mistaken for ashes if they had decrepitated.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first English settlers found the Indians of the tidewater region
of what now constitutes the Middle States using pearls quite freely and
esteeming them among their favorite treasures and ornaments. Captain
John Smith, and all the early chroniclers of the Virginia colony,
have given many accounts of this aboriginal use of pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>In view of the general interest awakened by the tercentenary of the
founding of Jamestown, and the exposition in commemoration thereof,
the “American Anthropologist” devoted its first number for 1907 principally
to topics relating to the Virginia Indians.<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c017'><sup>[527]</sup></a> Among these articles
is one of much interest by Mr. Charles C. Willoughby, of the
Peabody Museum at Cambridge, Massachusetts, dealing with the
tribes occupying tidewater Virginia at the time of the first colonization,
their habits and customs, their distribution, and their subsequent history
of diminution and almost of extinction. These were a branch of
the Algonquian stock, and extended as far south as the Neuse River in
North Carolina. To the south and west they were hemmed in by tribes
of Iroquoian and Siouan race, and on the north they were separated
from other hostile Indians by the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay.
The powerful confederacy under Powhatan comprised some thirty
tribes or “provinces,” covering most of the tidewater region of Virginia
proper. To the greater chiefs, John Smith states that tribute
was paid, consisting of “skinnes, beads, copper, pearle, deere, turkies,
wild beasts and corne.”<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c017'><sup>[528]</sup></a> Many other references in this article confirm
and illustrate this general statement, especially regarding pearls,
both as to their use by the living and their deposit with the remains of
the dead.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the account given of the native clothing, the outer mantles are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>described, made usually of deerskin with the hair removed, and bordered
with a fringe. These were often “couloured with some pretty
work,&nbsp;... beasts, fowle, tortayses, or such like imagery,”<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c017'><sup>[529]</sup></a> or adorned
with shells, white beads, copper ornaments, pearls, or the teeth of
animals.<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c017'><sup>[530]</sup></a> Strachey describes a wonderful cloak made of feather-work,
belonging to an Indian princess, the wife of a deposed chief,
Pipisco; with it she wore “pendants of great but imperfect couloured
and worse drilled pearles, which she put into her eares,” besides a long
necklace made of copper links.<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c017'><sup>[531]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>With regard to such ornaments, Mr. Willoughby says (p. 71) that
“the ears of both sexes were pierced with great holes, the women commonly
having three in each ear, in which were hung strings of bones,
shell, and copper beads, copper pendants, and other ornaments. Captain
Amidas met the wife of a chief who wore in her ears strings of
pearl beads as large as ‘great pease’ which hung down to her middle.<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c017'><sup>[532]</sup></a>
The husband of this woman wore five or six copper pendants in each
ear. It was a common custom for the men to wear a claw of a hawk,
eagle, turkey, or bear, or even a live snake as an ear ornament.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bracelets and neck ornaments of various kinds of beads were common.
Beads of copper seem to have been most highly valued in the
early colonial period. These were made of ‘shreeds of copper, beaten
thinne and bright, and wound up hollowe,’ and were sometimes strung
alternately with pearls which were occasionally stained to render them
more attractive.<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c017'><sup>[533]</sup></a> Beads of polished bone or shell were strung into
necklaces either alone or with perforated pearls or copper beads.
Some of these chains were long enough to pass several times around
the neck. Necklaces of such construction as to be easily identified
were worn by messengers as a proof of good faith. Powhatan gave
Sir Thomas Dale a pearl necklace, and requested that any messenger
sent by Dale to him should wear it as a guaranty that the message was
authentic.”<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c017'><sup>[534]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>“Pearls of various shapes and sizes were comparatively common, but
symmetrical pearls of uniform size were more rare. Strachey writes
of having seen ‘manie chaynes and braceletts (of pearls) worne by
the people, and wee have found plentie of them in the sepulchers of
their kings, though discoloured by burning the oysters in the fier, and
deformed by grosse boring.’ One of Hariot’s companions obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>from the Indians about five thousand pearls, from which a sufficient
number of good quality and of uniform size were obtained to make a
‘fayre chaine, which for their likenesse and uniformitie in roundnesse,
orientness and pidenesse of many excellent colours, with equalitie in
greatnesse, were verie fayre and rare.’<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c017'><sup>[535]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>“Those who have examined the thousands of pearls from the Ohio
mounds, to be mentioned later, can readily understand these conditions.
The pearl beads from the mounds vary in diameter from about
an eighth of an inch to nearly an inch, the great majority being small
and irregular, although there are many among them of good form and
value. It is probable that most of the Virginia pearls were obtained
from the fresh-water mussel (Unio)”; not unlikely from the common
marine clam (<i>Venus mercenaria</i>), or the common oyster (<i>Ostrea
virginica</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>As regards the burial of pearls with the dead and their use in religious
rites, curious and quite full accounts are given by Strachey,
Smith, Hariot, and Beverley.<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c017'><sup>[536]</sup></a> There was a “temple,” also occupied
as a residence by one or more priests, in the territory of every chief.
This building was usually some eighteen or twenty feet wide, and
varied in length from thirty to one hundred feet, with an entrance at
the eastern end, and the western portion partitioned off with mats to
form a sort of sanctuary or “chancel.” Within this were kept the
dried bodies of deceased chiefs, and an image of the god, called Okee,
made in the shape of a man, “all black, dressed with chaynes of perle.”
Full descriptions of these idols and their manufacture are given by
Hariot and Beverley, also of the process of preserving the remains of
the chiefs.<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c017'><sup>[537]</sup></a> After the body had been disemboweled, the skin was laid
back and the flesh was cut away from the bones. When this operation
was completed, the skeleton, held together by its ligaments, was again
inclosed in the skin, and stuffed with white sand, or with “pearle, copper,
beads, and such trash sowed in a skynne.”<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c017'><sup>[538]</sup></a> It was then dressed
in fine skins and adorned with all sorts of valuables, including strings
of pearls and beads. The same kinds of treasures were also deposited
in a basket at the feet of the mummy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Captain Smith describes the temple of Powhatan, at Uttamussack,
which was in charge of seven priests, and was held in great awe by
“the salvages.” At a place called Orapaks, was also his treasure-house,
fifty or sixty yards long, frequented only by priests, where he
kept a great amount of skins, beads, pearls, and copper, stored up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>against the time of his death and burial. A vivid account is given
of the four grotesque images that stood guard at the corners of this
building, all made “evill favouredly according to their best workmanship.”<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c017'><sup>[539]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The use of pearls as ornaments, and their deposit with the remains
of chiefs and persons of distinction, have already been described as
familiar among the Indian tribes of tidewater Virginia, in the notes
above cited from early explorers and colonists. It is a curious circumstance,
however, that this habit does not appear to have extended in
that part of the country much beyond the dominions of Powhatan, as
no pearls have been noted in the Indian graves in Maryland. This
statement, in reply to a letter of special inquiry, is made by Dr. P. R.
Uhler, of the Peabody Institute of Baltimore, who has been making
very careful studies of all aboriginal remains in that region, for the
Maryland Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would seem from this and other evidence, that the use and appreciation
of pearls must have been in some way a tribal matter, familiar
to some and not to others, of the Indian peoples. In the Mississippi
Valley, the ancient population known as the mound-builders, by some
regarded as a distinct and earlier race, and by others as of true Indian
stock, although much more advanced in arts and culture, have left in
their mounds most remarkable quantities of pearls. But here again,
the same feature appears, that these treasures are not found wherever
there are mounds, but only in certain regions. Of these, by far the
most celebrated is that of the Scioto and Miami valleys, in Ohio. Outside
of these, no large amounts have been found, and only at a few
localities are they met with at all.</p>

<p class='c013'>The valleys of the Miami and Scioto rivers and their tributaries
contain many remarkable mounds and “earthworks,” which have attracted
much attention, and have been more or less explored at different
times, with increasing care and thoroughness as archæological
science has advanced. It may be well to give a brief, general account
of these investigations and some leading features of the mounds as a
whole, before going into particulars as to the occurrence of pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first important and scientific study of these remarkable structures
was that conducted in the early forties by Dr. Edwin H. Davis
and Mr. E. George Squier, and published in their celebrated and
standard work entitled “Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley,”
issued by the Smithsonian Institution in 1848. This book and the
“Correspondence” in regard to the mounds by the same writers, published
in 1847, were the first works issued by the Smithsonian Institution.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>According to Squier and Davis,<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c017'><sup>[540]</sup></a> two quarts of pearls were originally
deposited in one of these mounds. The writers consider that
the pearls were probably derived from the fisheries in the southern
waters, and they regard their presence in the Ohio mounds as a proof
of “an extensive communication with southern and tropical regions
and a migration from that direction.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A number of pearls or pearl beads from the Ohio mounds and which
formerly belonged to the Squier and Davis collection, are now in the
Blackmore Museum at Salisbury, England. According to a communication
from Dr. H. P. Blackmore, director of the museum, these
pearls, which originally formed five necklaces, have been much injured
by the action of fire at the time the bodies of those interred in the
mounds were burned. Mr. Blackmore considers that the greater part
of the pearl beads are of mother-of-pearl cut from some large shell,
made into a round shape and perforated, but, after very careful examination,
he is of the opinion that about ten may be classed as natural
pearls. Their present color is a dull, leaden gray, rather lighter than
the “black pearl” of commerce. The size of these pearls or beads
varies from four millimeters to twenty millimeters in diameter. One
of the necklaces consists of thirty-three beads well graduated, but of a
dead white color from the action of the earth.</p>

<p class='c013'>A quarter of a century later, when the Centennial Exposition was in
preparation, the Smithsonian Institution undertook the formation of a
public exhibit illustrating American archæology, and engaged Prof.
F. W. Putnam, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, to open and examine
some of the most remarkable of the mounds described by Squier and
Davis. These explorations were continued for some years, partly for
the government and partly for the Peabody Museum of Archæology at
Cambridge, and their results were exhibited at the Columbian Exposition
in 1893. The mounds explored were chiefly in the valley of the
Little Miami, and particularly those known as the Turner group.</p>

<p class='c013'>A very important series of explorations was also carried on by Mr.
Warren K. Moorehead, covering the years from 1887 to 1893, largely
in preparation for the Columbian Exposition. These investigations
were mainly in the Scioto valley, in the counties of Ross, Franklin, and
Pickaway, Ohio. Among the most important results then obtained
were those from the mounds of the “Porter” and “Hopewell” groups,
in Ross County.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since that time, much valuable work has been done by Mr. Moorehead
and others, and particularly under the auspices of the Ohio State
Archæological and Historical Society. The latest and most complete
investigation was made for this society in 1903, by its curator, Prof.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>William C. Mills, in the Harness mound, seven miles north of Chillicothe,
Ohio, near the Scioto River, in Ross County. This locality had
been previously explored in part, by Professor Putnam in 1885, and
Mr. Moorehead in 1896; it was now systematically examined down to
the original surface at every point.</p>

<p class='c013'>Squier and Davis divided these ancient monuments into four
classes: (1) Altar mounds, which contain what appear to be altars,
and are also called hearths, of stone or hardened clay; (2) Burial
mounds, containing human bones; (3) Temple mounds, with neither
altars nor bones, but seeming to have had some special religious significance;
and (4) Anomalous mounds, including “mounds of observation”
and others of mixed or uncertain character. The burials are
found to be of two kinds, simple interment and cremation; and these
are sometimes met with in the same mound.</p>

<p class='c013'>This classification has been generally followed in describing these
ancient structures, although the whole subject is obscure and difficult,
from our ignorance of the purposes and conditions of their formation.
In many of the mounds of the first two classes especially, not only
have pearls been found, but quantities of interesting and remarkable
objects, many of which have been brought from distant points, and
prove clearly the existence of an extensive intertribal commerce at a
remote period. Galena from Illinois and Wisconsin, mica from
North Carolina, obsidian from beyond the Rocky Mountains, and sea-shells
from the Gulf coast, are among these objects, and particularly
native copper from Lake Superior, from which many articles were
fashioned by hammering. Pearls are extremely abundant, and were
at first supposed to have been brought from the coast, and may have
been the pearls of the common clam and the common oyster, the pearls
being found in opening the mollusks for food; but the recent development
of pearl hunting in the western rivers, where the fresh-water
mussels (Unios) are so abundant and produce such beautiful
pearls, shows that these treasures were undoubtedly gathered, partly,
if not wholly, in the region where the mounds exist. The enormous
numbers found are, indeed, no source of surprise, as such quantities
of pearls have been obtained, for over twenty years past, from the
same regions. The mollusks are still abundant in all the streams of
the Mississippi Valley, except where they have been reduced or
exterminated by the reckless methods of pearl hunting employed
where the “pearl fever” has prevailed.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is quite possible that the fresh-water Unios were not sought for
their pearls alone, but were also used as food, and perhaps as bait for
fishing. They were evidently gathered in great quantities, as is shown
by the old heaps of shells found along the banks of streams at many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>points; and doubtless there are multitudes of such heaps that have
never been observed. They are known as far north as Idaho, as communicated
by Dr. Robert N. Bell, State mineralogist, and they extend
still farther north, as noted by Dr. Harlan I. Smith, in his “Preliminary
Notes on the Archæology of the Yakima Valley.”<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c017'><sup>[541]</sup></a> He says:
“Small heaps of fresh-water clam-shells were examined, but these
being only about five feet in diameter and as many inches in depth, are
hardly to be compared to the immense shell-heaps of the coast.”</p>

<p class='c013'>These Unio shell-heaps are frequent in the South, and some of the
Spanish chroniclers of De Soto’s expedition in 1540–1541, describe the
gathering and cooking of the mussels, and the finding of occasional
pearls therein. The same writers also give glowing accounts of the
pearls possessed by the natives. Some of these accounts may be exaggerated,
but they cannot be wholly so. It would seem that some of
the pearls may have come from marine shells, and others from those
of the rivers and streams; but there are few pearl-producing shells on
our own coasts, and it is not very likely that there was any trade or
intercourse with the West Indian Islands, where marine pearls occur
freely.</p>

<p class='c013'>Albert H. Pickett, in his “History of Alabama,” refers to the accounts
of De Soto’s historian, Garcilasso de la Vega, and holds that
the pearls which he noted were evidently from the Unios of Alabama.
“Heaps of mussel shells,” he says, “are now to be seen on our river
banks wherever Indians used to live. They were much used by the ancient
Indians for some purpose, and old warriors have informed me
that their ancestors once used the shells to temper the clay with which
they made their vessels. But as thousands of the shells lie banked up,
some deep in the ground, we may also suppose that the Indians in De
Soto’s time, everywhere in Alabama, obtained pearls from them. There
can be no doubt about the quantity of pearls found in this State and
Georgia in 1540, but they were of a coarser and more valueless kind
than the Spaniards supposed. The Indians used to perforate them and
string them around their necks and arms like beads.”<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c017'><sup>[542]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The use of fragments of these shells in tempering the clay for pottery,
alluded to in the preceding paragraph, is well known. Prof.
Daniel S. Martin describes an old village site in South Carolina, near
the Congaree River, a few miles south of the city of Columbia, where
the ground had been plowed, and along the furrows the soil was
gleaming with brilliant pearly fragments of Unio shells, intermingled
with bits of pottery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Clarence B. Moore discovered pearls pierced for stringing in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>several of the mounds at Moundville, Alabama. He also found a
sheet-copper pendant, elongated oval in outline, with an excised repoussé
decoration, embracing a swastika within a circle, and a triangle.
This pendant, which lay near the skull of burial No. 132, bears a perforated
pearl nearly seven millimeters in diameter and weighing about
nine grains; it is fastened to the pendant by a piece of vegetable fiber
that passes through the pearl. With another burial (No. 162), the
skeleton of an adult, was an elliptical gorget of sheet-copper decorated
with a pearl.<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c017'><sup>[543]</sup></a> In a personal communication Mr. Moore states that
all the pearls found by him in the mounds were very much disintegrated
by the lapse of time; he also writes that he has never found any
shells immediately with the pearls, although masses of Unio shells
were often met with in the mounds. He believes the shell-fish had
been used for food.</p>

<p class='c013'>Unio shell-heaps exist likewise on the shores of the inland lakes of
Florida, and in middle Georgia and Alabama; and several of them on
the banks of the Savannah River, above Augusta, are fully described
by Colonel Charles C. Jones.<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c017'><sup>[544]</sup></a> He says: “In these relic-beds no two
parts of the same shell are, as a general rule, found in juxtaposition.
The hinge is broken, and the valves of the shell, after having been artificially
torn asunder, seem to have been carelessly cast aside and allowed
to accumulate.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus, in addition to the historical evidence, physical proof is abundant
of the pearl fisheries of the aboriginal tribes of the South. In
order to ascertain the precise varieties of shells from which the southern
Indians obtained their pearls, Colonel Jones invited an expression
of opinion from a number of scientists whose studies rendered them
familiar with the conchology of the United States. Their responses
throw considerable light upon this inquiry, though with some curious
variation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Prof. William S. Jones, of the University of Georgia, says that he
has seen small pearls in many of the Unios found in that State.</p>

<p class='c013'>Prof. Jeffries Wyman, on the other hand, after a careful and extensive
series of excavations in the shell-heaps of Florida, failed to find
a single pearl. “It is hardly probable,” he remarks, “that the Spaniards
could have been mistaken as to the fact of the ornaments of the
Indians being pearls, but in view of their frequent exaggerations, I am
almost compelled to the belief that there was some mistake; and possibly
they may not have distinguished between the pearls and the shell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>beads, some of which would correspond with the size and shape of the
pearls mentioned by the Spaniards.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Prof. Joseph Jones, whose investigations throw much valuable light
upon the contents of the ancient tumuli of Tennessee, says: “I do not
remember finding a genuine pearl in the many mounds which I have
opened in the valleys of the Tennessee, the Cumberland, the Harpeth,
and elsewhere. Many of the pearls described by the Spaniards were
probably little else than polished beads cut out of large sea-shells and
from the thicker portions of fresh-water mussels, and prepared so as
to resemble pearls. I have examined thousands of these, and they all
present a laminated structure, as if carved out of thick shells and sea
conchs.” This point will be referred to again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Charles Rau<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c017'><sup>[545]</sup></a> writes: “I learned from Dr. Samuel G. Bristow,
who was a surgeon in the Army of the Cumberland during the Civil
War, that mussels of the Tennessee River were occasionally eaten ‘as
a change’ by the soldiers of that corps, and pronounced no bad article
of diet. Shells of the Unio are sometimes found in Indian graves,
where they had been deposited with the dead, to serve as food during
the journey to the land of spirits.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Brinton saw on the Tennessee River and its tributaries numerous
shell-heaps consisting almost exclusively of the <i>Unio virginianus</i>
(Lamarck). In every instance he found shell-heaps close to the
water-courses, on the rich alluvial bottom-land. He says: “The mollusks
had evidently been opened by placing them on a fire. The Tennessee
mussel is margaritiferous, and there is no doubt but that it was
from this species that the early tribes obtained the hoards of pearls
which the historian of De Soto’s exploration estimated by bushels, and
which were so much prized as ornaments.”<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c017'><sup>[546]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A source has recently been pointed out whence small pearls, and
perhaps some fine specimens, could have been obtained by the Indians
of Florida, and in considerable quantities. In the Unios of some of the
fresh-water lakes of that State, there were found not less than 3000
pearls, most of them small, but many large enough to be perforated and
worn as beads. From one Unio there were taken eighty-four seed-pearls;
from another, fifty; from a third, twenty, and from several, ten
or twelve each. The examinations were chiefly confined to Lake
Griffin and its vicinity. It is said that upon one of the isles in Lake
Okeechobee are the remains of an old pearl fishery, and it is proposed
to open the shells of this lake, which are large, in hopes of finding
pearls of superior size and quality.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>The use of the pearl as an ornament by the southern Indians, and
the quantities of shells opened by them in various localities, make it
seem strange that it is not more frequently met with in the relic-beds
and sepulchral tumuli of that region; but, after exploring many shell- and
earth-mounds, Colonel Charles C. Jones failed, except in a few instances,
to find pearls.<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c017'><sup>[547]</sup></a> A few were obtained in an extensive relic-bed
on the Savannah River, above Augusta, the largest being four tenths
of an inch in diameter, but all of them blackened by fire. Many of
the smaller mounds on the coast of Georgia do not contain pearls, because
at the period of their construction the custom of burning the
dead appears to have prevailed very generally; hence, it may be that
the pearls were either immediately consumed or so seriously injured
as to crumble out of sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>This absence of pearls tends somewhat to confirm the opinion that
beads made from the thicker portions of shells that were carved, perforated,
and brilliant with nacre, were regarded by the imaginative
Spaniards as pearls. More minute investigation, however, will doubtless
reveal the existence of pearls in localities where the pearl-bearing
shells were collected. Perforated pearls have been found in an ancient
burying-ground located near the bank of the Ogeechee River, in
Bryan County, Georgia; and many years ago, after a heavy freshet
on the Oconee River, which laid bare many Indian graves in the neighborhood
of the large mounds on Poullain’s plantation, fully a hundred
pearls of considerable size were gathered.</p>

<p class='c013'>It seems quite clear that many of the pearls reported by the early
Spanish voyagers were really such, although it is well known also
that shell beads have been found in mounds in connection with
pearls; but the numbers found in Ohio, by Professor Putnam, Mr.
Moorehead, and others, leave no room for doubt in this matter. That
the Indians of the South also had these pearls, both drilled and undrilled,
is beyond question.</p>

<p class='c013'>The same fact comes to view, however, in these various accounts,
that has been alluded to already, <i>viz.</i>, that the use of pearls among
the aborigines appears to have been local, and probably tribal. All
the fresh waters of North America contain Unios, especially in the
Mississippi basin and in the South, and all the Unios are more or less
pearl-bearing; but it is only at certain points that pearls are found
deposited in ancient graves, sometimes, however, in extraordinary
quantities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Father Louis Hennepin relates that the Indians along the Mississippi
wore bracelets and earrings of fine pearls, which they spoilt,
having nothing to bore them with but fire. He adds: “They gave us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>to understand that they received them in exchange for their calumets
from nations inhabiting the coast of the great lake to the southward,
which I take to be the Gulph of Florida.”<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c017'><sup>[548]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The statement here made, that the Indians perforated their pearls
only “with fire,” evidently refers to the use of a heated copper wire,
or point, as mentioned by Pickett and others of the early explorers.
This point is of importance, as apparently indicating a marked difference
between the Indians met with by the first European visitors, and
the mound-building people of an earlier time, among whom the perforation
was made with small stone drills. On this point, a recent letter
from Prof. Wm. C. Mills, who has conducted the very full exploration
of the Harness mound in Ohio, is of interest. He describes the
small and carefully-wrought flint drills, which he found, and believes
to have been made and used for this purpose. In size and form they
answer all requirements; they are delicate little implements, somewhat
T-shaped or gimlet-shaped, an inch and a quarter long; the narrow
boring part is about an inch in length and tapers from one eighth of an
inch to quite a fine point; the wider upper end is abruptly expanded
into the transverse handle, which is about a quarter of an inch thick,
<i>i.e.</i>, lengthwise of the instrument, and half an inch in span, <i>i.e.</i>, across,
so as to give a good hold for the fingers to rotate the drill, just as in
an ordinary gimlet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Passing now to the actual discoveries of pearls in the mounds of
the Mississippi Valley, these will be reviewed in the order of the successive
explorations in which they were made known. As already
stated, the only region where any large amounts have been encountered,
is that of the Scioto and Miami valleys in Ohio. Even here,
pearls are found only at certain points, and though the numbers are
great, the graves which contain them are few. They were apparently
buried only with the remains of individuals of especial distinction,
probably either chiefs or eminent medicine men. The accounts of
recent explorations in these mounds bring to mind very forcibly the
statement before cited from Captain John Smith, as to Powhatan’s
treasure-house, where all his most valued articles, including pearls,
were collected and kept, in preparation for his death and burial.
Pearls appear also to have been used only by the more cultured tribes,
and were kept in the larger and more prosperous communities exclusively.
They are confined to the great “mound groups,” and are
not found in isolated mounds. The tumuli of northern Ohio, the hill
mounds, and the village sites along the smaller streams, have yielded
practically none.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to the manner of burial, the pearls vary greatly in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>present condition. Where they have been placed with cremated bodies,
they are, of course, much damaged, being blackened and largely decomposed.
Otherwise, although injured in color and luster, the mere
fact of burial in the ground has not entirely ruined them. They are
generally perforated, so as to be strung or attached to garments, and
traces of both these methods of use are sometimes clearly shown.</p>

<p class='c013'>The term “pearl beads,” often employed by writers, is uncertain in
meaning; as it may refer either to actual pearls, bored so as to be
strung, or to imitations thereof made from pearly shell. With regard
to this point, although such quantities have been obtained, there seems
to have been very little close examination as to their structure, which
would at once indicate the facts, according as the minute layers of the
pearly material are concentric or not. The only distinct testimony is
that we have cited above from Prof. Joseph Jones,<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c017'><sup>[549]</sup></a> who states that he
has examined large numbers, and found them to be apparently cut
from shells. He makes the suggestion that they may have been
carved from the thicker portions of the fresh-water Unios. This is
not only probable, but would go far to solve the mystery of the
enormous numbers found, as compared with anything known of the
yield of genuine pearls by these mollusks, even with all the pearl hunting
of recent years. An interesting fact bearing directly on this question
is the discovery in the Taylor mound, at Oregonia, Warren
County, Ohio, of several Unio shells in which had been made a circular
hole, two thirds of an inch in diameter, either for some ornamental
use of the shell or to extract pieces to be shaped into beads. These
may have been made in either of two ways. Firstly, by breaking
pieces of the shell from one of the valves, as a lapidary “roughs out”
a piece of gem material before he begins to grind it into shape; or,
secondly, by cutting out a circular disk of shell by means of a hollow
copper drill or a hollow reed, just as they perforated hard pieces of
quartz or granite for pipes, or as they trephined circular disks from
the skulls. Decorated disks of Unio shell were also found in the same
mound. If the ancient people made beads in this manner, there is
little difficulty in accounting for the quantities described, especially in
connection with the evident gathering of Unios on a large scale, as
shown by the widely distributed shell-heaps already described. They
certainly did make beads from various marine shells, and these are
found with the pearl beads in many of the mounds, as particularly
noted by Professor Jones, cited above, and by others.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the recent exploration of the Harness mound, by Professor Mills,
a very curious discovery was made of imitation pearls of a kind never
before met with; these were made of clay, modeled apparently after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>the larger natural pearls associated with them, and after being baked
hard, had been “covered with a flexible mica,” so as to resemble
pearls.<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c017'><sup>[550]</sup></a> The mica was a silvery mica that may have been burned and
would pulverize into a gray powder with a pearly luster, as almost all
micas are too resilient to be attached in any other way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Taking up now the history of pearl discovery in the mounds, the
first definite record goes back to about 1844, when perforated pearls
were found by Dr. Edwin H. Davis<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c017'><sup>[551]</sup></a> on the hearths of five distinct
groups of mounds in Ohio, and sometimes in such abundance that they
could be gathered by the hundred. They were generally of irregular
form, mostly pear-shaped, though perfectly round ones were also
found among them. The smaller specimens measured about one
fourth of an inch in diameter, but the largest had a diameter of three
quarters of an inch.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next great discovery of these Unio pearls was in the Porter
group of mounds, in the Little Miami Valley, explored by Prof. Frederick
W. Putnam, and Dr. Charles L. Metz, who procured over 60,000
pearls, nearly two bushels, drilled and undrilled, undoubtedly of Unio
origin; all of them, however, decayed or much altered, and of no commercial
value. In 1884 these scientists examined the Marriott mound,
where they found nearly one hundred Unio shells, and among other
objects of special interest six canine teeth of bears, that were perforated
by a lateral hole near the edge at the point of greatest curvature
of the root, so that by passing a cord through this, the tooth could
be fastened to any object or worn as an ornament. Two of these
teeth had a hole bored through near the end of the root on the side
opposite the lateral perforation, and the hole countersunk in order to
receive a large spherical pearl, about three eighths of an inch in diameter.
When the teeth were found, the pearls were in place, although
chalky from decay. Upward of 250 pearl beads were found here,
concerning which they say: “The pearl beads found in the several
positions mentioned are natural pearls, probably obtained from the
several species of Unios in the Ohio rivers. In size they vary from
one tenth of an inch to over half an inch in diameter, and many are
spherical. They are neatly drilled, and the larger from opposite sides.
These pearls are now chalky, and crumble on handling, but when fresh
they would have formed brilliant necklaces and pendants.”<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c017'><sup>[552]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>It is easy to see, even at a glance, that most of those in this great
deposit of 60,000 are true pearls. Many are very irregular in form,
and quite a number are the elongated, somewhat feather-shaped,
“hinge pearls,” that are found in the region of the hinge teeth of
Unios. A large and interesting exhibit of these is shown in the Field
Museum of Natural History, Chicago. But thousands of spherical
pearls were also obtained, from the “altars” or “hearths” of mounds
belonging to the first division of Squier and Davis’s classification,
above noted. From the Turner group, in Clermont County, in the
Little Miami Valley, Professor Putnam obtained for the Peabody
Museum as much as half a bushel of pearls of this character. As these
had been exposed to fire, nearly all were blackened, some cracked, and
all greatly impaired.<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c017'><sup>[553]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The next great series of explorations were those conducted by Mr.
W. K. Moorehead in the Scioto Valley, in the counties of Ross, Franklin
and Pickaway, Ohio. He opened and examined a number of
mounds, and found pearls or pearl beads in ten or twelve of them, but
the larger deposits were confined to certain limited districts, which
seem to have been occupied by tribes more advanced in culture and in
traffic than the rest. In these, the pearls and also objects of other
kinds brought from a distance, are principally found. The scattered
mounds, not associated with any village or community sites, have few
of these valuable objects.</p>

<p class='c013'>But even where they are found freely, pearls were apparently used
or possessed by only a few individuals. Mr. Moorehead investigated
in all 117 burial mounds, containing about 1400 skeletons. Pearls
were met with in only seven of these mounds, and in connection with
but twenty-two skeletons. These, however, yielded a total of 2600
pearls, apparently from Unios, the numbers found with single skeletons
varying from 18 to 602, an average of 118. It thus appears that
in Mr. Moorehead’s researches, pearls were found in about one mound
out of seventeen, and in these, with about one skeleton out of eight.</p>

<p class='c013'>From “altar mounds,” pearls have been in some cases taken in vast
numbers. Professor Putnam’s discoveries are mentioned above; and
Mr. Moorehead obtained tens of thousands from two altars or hearths
in the Hopewell group, which will be described hereafter.</p>

<p class='c013'>When found in the burial mounds with skeletons, pearls are generally
seen to have been placed at the wrists or ankles, or about the
neck, or in the mouth. Sometimes they are found on copper plates,
and occasionally they show evidence of having been sewn or attached
to a garment. Particulars on these points will be given further on.
Mr. Moorehead has also found bears’ teeth, set with pearls, as Putnam
and Metz did in the Marriott mound, lying with or near skeletons.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the case of the altar mounds, there seems to have been a different
procedure, not a burial, but a great funeral sacrifice in honor of some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>very distinguished person, in which treasures of every kind, including
great stores of pearls, were consumed, or meant to be. Of this, Mr.
Moorehead says, in a letter to the author: “In the case of all altar
offerings, a fire had been kindled&nbsp;... and all these things were
heaped upon it. They were utterly ruined, save a few;&nbsp;... those at
the top were not so much affected as those at the bottom.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Moorehead’s investigations already mentioned were in the
years 1888 to 1891 inclusive; he next took up especially the remarkable
Hopewell groups of mounds, in 1891–1892, and explored these
extensively for the archæological exhibit at the World’s Columbian
Exposition of 1893, at Chicago.<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c017'><sup>[554]</sup></a> This was his most important and
elaborate investigation, and will be described in some detail. In 1896,
he made a partial exploration of the Harness mound near Chillicothe,
which has been fully completed more recently by Prof. William C.
Mills, and will also be described further on.</p>

<p class='c013'>The investigations made in the Hopewell group of mounds were
recorded by Mr. Moorehead in a series of articles in the “Antiquarian.”<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c017'><sup>[555]</sup></a>
He gives a general account of the remarkable region of ancient
remains in Ross County, Ohio. The State archæological map
shows the “mound belt,” as a strip of country some fifteen miles wide
and one hundred miles long, extending through the Scioto Valley, from
about Columbus to Portsmouth. The ancient works noted on this
map, though not all that exist there, yet number over 900 mounds,
24 village sites, 36 circles of earth and stone, 87 other inclosures and
works of similar character, and 31 sites of gravel or kame burials.
Five groups of mounds in particular exist in Ross County, all of them
showing a “high culture” state. “All of the lower Scioto Valley,” says
Mr. Moorehead, “was occupied by a mound-building tribe ranking
higher in intelligence and numerically stronger than that of any other
section of the whole Ohio region.” Among the many remarkable
ancient works in that part of the country, the five groups in Ross
County are the most important, and among these, the Hopewell group
is preëminent. The first published notice of them, which appeared in
1820, was by Mr. Caleb Atwater.<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c017'><sup>[556]</sup></a> Squier and Davis examined and
described them in the years 1844–1846, and obtained large and notable
collections from them which are now in England, in the Blackmore
Museum at Salisbury, as not enough interest in such matters then existed
in America to induce the purchase and retention of these valuable
treasures. From that time until 1891, when Mr. Moorehead began his
explorations there, no one had paid much attention to these mounds, all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>published accounts being derived from those of Squier and Davis.
They described them under the name of Clark’s works, from the
owner of the farm within which they lie; but the property has since
passed into the possession of Mr. M. C. Hopewell. From this fact, yet
more from his kind and intelligent interest in the work of exploration,
his name has been given to the group.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Hopewell works are situated on the north fork of Paint Creek,
about one third of a mile from the stream. The intervening space is
low bottom-land, and the works stand upon a terrace about twenty feet
high, from which again there is a rather steep rise of thirty or forty
feet more, to the general level of the country. They consist of a
nearly quadrangular inclosure, about half a mile in length (strictly
2800 feet), and half as much in width, occupying the entire breadth
of the terrace. At its eastern end, this large inclosure opens into a
second and smaller one, an exact square of 850 feet. Within the main
inclosure are one or more village sites, a number of separate mounds,
and especially a group of several connected elevations, together known
as the Effigy mound, these being much the highest and most conspicuous,
and themselves surrounded by a semicircular inclosure. The
whole suggests a defensive work, or “walled town”; but the wall, although
strongly and carefully built, partly of stones and partly of hard
clay, is so low—only from four to six feet in height—that it could not
have been a very formidable obstacle to a vigorous assault; and, moreover,
the whole is overlooked and “commanded” from the bluff above
it. The mounds, as Squier and Davis examined them, were pronounced
to be mainly of the sacrificial or “altar” type. Since
their very full and accurate account was published, time and the
hand of man have reduced and almost obliterated portions of the
wall and some of the smaller mounds, while the creek has slightly
shifted its course. When they wrote their description, it was a little
nearer than it is now; and they then expressed the belief that
it had formerly washed the base of the terrace where the works are
located.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Moorehead’s exploring party, aided by Dr. H. T. Cresson,
began operations at this notable group of mounds in August, 1891,
and continued them through about seven months, without interruption,
much of the time in severe winter weather. The work was carried
on under authority of the Anthropological Department of the
Columbian Exposition of 1893, at Chicago. All the most interesting
and important of the very extensive body of relics obtained was displayed
there; and the whole remains as a permanent exhibit in the
Field (Columbian) Museum of Natural History.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Hopewell group comprises in all some twenty larger and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>smaller mounds within the general inclosure, besides a few unimportant
ones outside of it, and the main connected group in the special
inclosure near the center. These latter form together what is
known as the Effigy mound, a name based upon its general resemblance
to a reclining human figure; but it is not constructed on a
human or animal design, as are the effigy mounds properly so called.
After working for a time upon some of the others, and finding much
interesting material, Mr. Moorehead set his men to work upon the
Effigy mound, and spent most of his time and effort upon that remarkable
structure, of which he made a very thorough and systematic
exploration.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Effigy mound is about 500 feet long and 220 feet wide, and
rises 23 feet above the general surface at its highest point. It proves
to belong to the fourth class of Squier and Davis, those of mixed character,
with both altars and burials, as it contained three large altars
and as many as 175 skeletons, nearly all of adults.</p>

<p class='c013'>Reviewing now the entire exploration of the Hopewell group, the
first mound opened, known as No. 17, was of considerable size, nearly
ninety feet in diameter, and was notable for a layer of mica—some
3000 sheets—that extended almost entirely through it. It contained
a rude altar, with ashes and bones, some copper implements, bone
needles, sharks’ teeth, and nearly 200 pounds of bright galena. The
next examined, No. 18, contained several decayed skeletons, and a
good example of an “altar,” together with ornaments cut from
human skulls. The next, No. 19, had an altar of earth, partially
hardened by heat, which was taken out entire and boxed. It was
roughly cubical, about three feet each way. In the “bowl,” or concavity,
on the top of it, were various minor implements, with some
galena and mica, etc. The next attacked was a large mound, No. 2,
which had been partly opened by Squier and Davis, nearly fifty
years before. It is remarkable for its immense store of roughly
chipped flint disks, over 8000 in number, of which 600 were taken out
by Squier and Davis, and most of the remainder by Mr. Moorehead.
It would seem to have been a place of storage for partly worked material
of this kind, to preserve it from the hardening effect of long
exposure to the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Several other mounds yielded little of importance, save that from
the soil on the site of No. 1, which had been obliterated, were taken
a number of fragments of bone, curiously ornamented with finely
carved patterns. Two others, Nos. 4 and 5, had peculiarly constructed
altars, of which an extended account is given.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first discovery of pearls by Squier and Davis was made in their
mound No. 9, now obliterated by a railroad. With the pearls, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>report as found on the top of a small altar, broken instruments of
obsidian, cut patterns of mica, vestiges of cloth, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Moorehead’s first discovery of pearls was in a small but interesting
mound, No. 20, about forty feet in diameter. It had been reduced
by plowing to only some two feet in height; and its contents
would ere long have been broken into and scattered by the same
process. This was strictly a burial mound, and soon yielded five
skeletons, one of them being that of a child, nine or ten years of age.
With these bones were numerous objects: two large shells made into
cups for drinking, several copper articles and ornaments, among them
a broad copper bracelet encircling the right wrist, and several hundred
pearl and shell beads and small shells. The same mound
yielded later some other children’s remains, but with no important
objects. A finely polished pipe and two bear’s teeth coated with
copper were also found.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Moorehead points out the evidences of a long occupation of
this site by a cultured tribe, who had commerce with the South and
West more than with the North or East.</p>

<p class='c013'>Work was then begun, in the latter part of September, on a large
and important mound known as the Oblong (No. 23), 155 feet long
by 100 feet wide, with an elevation at present of 14 feet, and originally
of perhaps 20 feet. This mound yielded thirty-nine skeletons,
lying at depths varying from eight and three fourths to eleven feet
below the present surface, nearly on the base-line of the mound.
Some of these were surrounded by boulders, others were much
charred, and a good deal of variety exists in their condition, all of
which Mr. Moorehead describes particularly. All manner of relics
and objects were obtained, including pearl beads and a splendid copper
ax of seventeen pounds’ weight, of course entirely too large for any
practical use, and hence plainly a ceremonial object or badge of some
high distinction. Among the most remarkable of the many interesting
objects discovered here were the large canine teeth of bears,<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c017'><sup>[557]</sup></a> which
had not only been drilled through near the base of the root for suspension,
like many others, but had also been partly drilled at the
middle of one side, and a large pearl inserted into the cavity. These
singular ornaments were found at the neck of a skeleton, and had
evidently been worn as pendants. It will be remembered that almost
identical specimens were found by Professor Putnam in the Marriott
mound in the Miami Valley.<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c017'><sup>[558]</sup></a> The one here figured is now in the Field
Museum of Natural History, Chicago, with most of the other Hopewell
material.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another somewhat similar example of the taste and art of the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>people, also preserved in the Field Museum, came from the mound
known as No. 25. This consisted of a large figure of a bird, in hammered
copper, fifteen and seven eighths inches long, with a pearl
inserted to form the eye. The head is quite expressive, and the tail-feathers
well represented, although the wings and the general proportions
are rude. This is shown about one third of the actual length.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Effigy mound was next examined. The first trial shafts proved
it to be evidently of human construction, and not of glacial origin, as
some had supposed. One or two open cuts were then begun, using
teams with a large shovel until indications of burials were found, when
the further work would be carried on by hand, with extreme care.</p>

<p class='c013'>After about two weeks, in which time several skeletons were unearthed,
with some shells, beads, and copper ornaments, a burial of
extraordinary character was reached on November 14. Here was
lying a skeleton which the newspapers soon reported as “The King of
the Mound-Builders.” It was much decayed, but was covered and
surrounded with a wealth of relics. The skull was surmounted by a
tall cap or helmet of copper, from which extended a wonderful pair
of antlers, exactly imitating those of a deer, but made of wood and
covered with copper. The whole skeleton, to quote the words of Mr.
Moorehead, “glittered with mica, pearl, shell, and copper.” Plates
of the latter were above, beneath, and around it, with bears’ and
panthers’ teeth, etc., and over 1000 beads, many of them of pearl. The
succeeding month, during which the last cut was finished down to the
base-line, and a third one much advanced, revealed numerous skeletons,
with abundant objects of the same general kind, including a remarkable
separate deposit of copper articles of curious workmanship, ornaments
of cut mica, and one of cannel coal, fragments of meteoric iron and
celts made therefrom, and “many thousand pearl and shell beads.”
The latest trophy here unearthed was another enormous ax of copper,
nearly two feet in length, unparalleled in the world.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first altar was next reached; it was about four by five feet, and
some six inches deep, and had an immense variety of objects upon it
and around it, nearly all entirely ruined by the fire. Among them
were pearl beads.</p>

<p class='c013'>The largest altar had been not only heaped with all sorts of valuables,
but they had been piled around it so as to form a sloping mass of
twelve feet or more in diameter at the base. Among these was a layer
of mica plates of extraordinary size, eighteen or twenty inches in
diameter. It is not easy even now to obtain sheets of mica of such
dimensions, in any quantity. Carvings and effigies in bone and slate,
rock crystal arrow-heads, obsidian knives, etc., etc., damaged and
broken by heat, were cemented together by half-melted copper. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>pearl and shell beads taken out amid the ashes are estimated at not
less than 100,000.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Effigy mound, “a place for ceremony, for sacrifice, for burial,”
as Mr. Moorehead calls it, thus combining the character of the first
three classes distinguished by Squier and Davis, is seen not to have
been constructed at one time, but to have developed gradually through
perhaps a long period. The several altars, the more important burials,
the store of copper objects, each was surmounted by a small and separate
mound. “These may have been built on the level dance or ceremonial
floors, from time to time. When the entire floor was covered,
the people brought large quantities of earth and gravel, heaped it on
top of the irregular contour of the small mounds, and this formed the
present Effigy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The population that occupied the main inclosure was apparently not
very large, as compared with some other of the important earthworks,
such as Fort Ancient, or Madisonville. From the distribution of
village-site debris, Mr. Moorehead estimates that there could have been
only from two hundred to three hundred lodges, even if these were all
occupied at the same time. But the indications of traffic and of art
show that it must have been a community advanced in culture beyond
most of its neighbors. Mr. Moorehead believes it to have been a sort
of capital among a body of allied or affiliated tribes who made and
occupied the similar earthwork towns of the “mound belt,”—a center
of production and distribution of art objects, and a place for the holding
of great religious ceremonials. It may be noted, however, that
the art was developed in certain directions and not in others wherein
it might be expected. In hammered copper-work and in drilling, it
was most remarkable, in the latter extending even to the perforation
of quartz crystals, but of pottery there is little, and that not very
choice—a striking contrast to the abundant and elaborately ornamental
potter’s art of the tribes in the Southwest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tonti, the historian of La Salle’s expedition, in the eighteenth century,
states that La Salle actually saw mound-dwellers among southern
tribes of Indians, living very much as the Ohio mound-builders
must have done, and quite untouched as yet by any contact with the
whites. Tonti describes the dwellings, made of sun-dried mud and
with dome-shaped roofs of cane; two of them were larger and better
constructed than the rest, one the chief’s house and the other a temple,
both about forty feet square. The latter held the bones of deceased
chieftains, and was surmounted by three rude, wooden eagles. In
the center was apparently “a kind of altar,” where was maintained a
perpetual fire of logs, watched by two aged men. A recess, to which
strangers were not admitted, contained the treasures of the tribe, especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>pearls from the Gulf, as he was told. The chief returned the
visit of La Salle, coming in great state, with attendants, one of whom
bore a disk of copper, supposed to represent the sun, the chief’s great
ancestor.<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c017'><sup>[559]</sup></a> The wooden eagles recall the large copper bird taken
from mound No. 25 at Hopewell; and the copper disk carried before
the chief suggests a similar use for some of the large objects of the
same metal. The whole account is extremely interesting in its resemblance
to the Ohio remains.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most complete study of these ancient structures is that of the
Harness mound, not far distant from the Hopewell, conducted under
the direction of the Ohio State Archæological and Historical Society,
in 1905, by their curator and librarian, Prof. William C. Mills.<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c017'><sup>[560]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The Harness group contains within and about it fourteen mounds;
the works as a whole were described by Squier and Davis, on page 56 of
their great report (“Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley,”
1848), and have been frequently mentioned and pictured for their
striking form,—a large and perfect circle, opening at one side into a
smaller circle and also into an exact square. They are located, like
the Hopewell, in Ross County, and stand on a terrace of the Scioto
River, nearly a mile from its eastern bank, and about eight miles south
of Chillicothe.</p>

<p class='c013'>The square inclosure measures 1080 feet on each side, and the diameters
of the two circles are about 1600 feet for the larger and 650 feet
for the smaller. In general character, this group closely resembles
the Hopewell: there is the same low wall or embankment, some four
feet high, though without any ditch as at Hopewell, and the same
problem as to its object. A number of small mounds are placed here
and there, and one large and important one recalls the Effigy, though
it is somewhat less in size and much more regular in form. In 1846,
when Squier and Davis examined it, unfortunately most of the ground
was covered with woods; but these are gone, and the works have since
been much reduced by tillage and partly obliterated by railroad and
other constructions.</p>

<p class='c013'>The one large mound is named for the recent owner of the property,
Mr. Edwin Harness; the present owner, his son, Mr. John M. Harness,
aided and facilitated the explorations in every way. This fact, as
also in the case of Mr. Hopewell, stands in pleasing and honorable contrast
to the narrow policy of some land-owners, who refuse permission
for any such work, even when the structures are upon unused and
valueless ground.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>The large mound is an almost perfect oval in form, 160 feet long
and some 80 feet across at its widest point, which is about one third
of the way from the northern end; in height it is nearly 20 feet, or was
before its recent removal. It was partly explored by Squier and Davis
in 1846, and quite extensively by Professor Putnam in 1885, and,
unlike the Effigy mound, had been repeatedly opened and examined in
a small way by both official and unofficial explorers. In 1896, Mr. W.
K. Moorehead took up the work where Professor Putnam had stopped,
and carried it considerably further, under the auspices of the Ohio
Archæological and Historical Society; and the same body, in 1905,
commissioned Mr. Mills to resume and complete the examination, removing
the entire structure down to its base.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Harness mound, unlike the Effigy, was for burial purposes
only. There must have been nearly two hundred. Squier and Davis
found one of these, and possibly another which they mistook for an
“altar”; and they state their belief that the mound probably contained
other burials which their two pits had not revealed. Professor
Putnam encountered 12 burials, Mr. Moorehead 27, and
the final exploration 133, making a total of 174. Besides these, an
unknown number have been disturbed and removed by occasional explorers.
Of the 174 recorded, only ten had been buried without being
burned; the rest were all cremated, some where they were laid, but
most of them elsewhere, and the ashes brought and placed in the grave.
This was in all cases carefully prepared, within a small inclosure of
logs, the decayed and charred remains of which are clearly traceable.
The entire mound itself had been outlined with posts set in the ground.
the holes and impressions remaining as evidence of the fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Mills outlines the history of this mound, in a way that recalls
Mr. Moorehead’s views as to the gradual growth of the Effigy. It
began as a place for the holding of funeral rites and the deposit of the
dead, marked out by lines of posts, which show that it was from time
to time enlarged. Finally, when the place was substantially filled,
earth and gravel were deposited over the whole, and slabs of stone
(particularly noted by Squier and Davis) were laid around it, upon the
lower part of the slope.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much description is given of the separate graves or burial chambers,
which are of several types, and of the various details of the cremated
and uncremated interments. The mound is rich in relics, although
none of the profuse sacrificial accumulations of the “altars” were encountered,
this being a mound of burial only. The relics are of the
same kind, in general, as those found in the Hopewell group, and to
specify them in detail would be only repetition. From the 133 graves
opened in Mr. Mills’s final investigation, no less than 1200 specimens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>were obtained for the museum of the Archæological Society at Columbus.
Among these were artefacts of Lake Superior copper (and some
pieces of native silver), large shells from the Gulf, galena, obsidian,
and much mica, both in “blocks” and cut into ornaments, all showing
the same range of aboriginal commerce as already described at Hopewell.
In reference to pearls, the following are the principal observations:</p>

<p class='c013'>Beads made from Unio pearls were very abundant everywhere in
the Harness mound, as also beads of shell. They are found in such
position as to show that they were strung and worn around the neck
or wrists. One burial (No. 100) had some 2100 pearl beads, all
rather small, and some of them perfectly round. Several hundred
were obtained, however, that ranged from one quarter to one half an
inch in diameter. A number of these are shown of natural size.
The larger pearls, instead of being bored through for beads, are frequently
somewhat flattened by grinding, and then pierced with two
holes so as to attach them to a fabric. Very large ones were sometimes
set in copper,—a style of work never observed before. Mr.
Mills says of this: “Large and select pearls were flattened upon
one side by grinding, and then placed upon a circular disk of copper a
little larger than the pearl. The edges were then turned (up) around
the pearl, holding it in place. Not only were pearls set in this way,
but various pieces of shell cut in a circular form.” Fine examples of
this unique style of jewelry, of natural size, and another copper setting
of like character, from which the pearl has been lost, are shown in
plates facing pages 499 and 510.</p>

<p class='c013'>More curious still is the discovery of imitation pearls, made of
clay, and apparently modeled from real ones as they reproduce all the
irregularities of form of the true pearls. They could easily have
been made more nearly spherical, as the beads cut from shell are so
regular as to look as though made by machinery. These somewhat
irregular clay imitations, found with the genuine pearls, were first
coated with a pulverent mica and then burned so as to preserve a
pearly appearance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other forms of art work were abundantly represented in the Harness
mound, such as carvings and decorations in stone and bone; a
variety of textile fabrics, of which remnants are preserved when they
were in contact with plates of copper, the salts of the metal having
penetrated the fabric and prevented its entire decay; very skilful work
in copper, and to some extent in native silver and meteoric iron; and
numerous fragments of pottery, more or less ornamental with simple
impressed patterns. The “culture,” as a whole, appears to have been
equal, and very similar, to that of the Hopewell community, and these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>are regarded as having been the most advanced among the Ohio
mound-builders; while the term “Fort Ancient culture” is applied to a
somewhat lower grade in the matter of arts, which has its chief illustration
among the builders and occupants of that celebrated work. By
such researches, thus minutely and systematically conducted, there is
now beginning to be possible something like a classification of these
ancient unknown tribes, which will doubtless be developed more fully,
as investigation shall be extended and its results combined and compared.</p>

<p class='c013'>As to pearls in the mounds of Illinois, we are informed by the veteran
archæologist, Dr. J. F. Snyder, that in 1889 he found the skeletons
of three adult Indians at the base of a small mound on the bluffs
of the Sangomon River in Cass County. These skeletons were in a
squatting posture; artefacts—such as greenstone celts, a bicave stone
and a heavy pipe—had only been deposited with one of them. Around
each wrist and ankle of this skeleton were perforated beads made
from <i>Marginella</i> shells, and resting on the sternum was a solitary
pearl which had evidently formed the center of a necklace of the same
small marine shells. Although much decayed, it still retained something
of its original luster. It was spherical, measured approximately
seven eighths of an inch in diameter, and was perforated through the
middle. Dr. Snyder also states that at the base of one of the large
mounds he opened in 1895, in Brown County, on the west side of the
Illinois River, he discovered a number of the large canine teeth of the
bear, perforated at the roots, so as to be used for necklaces. On the
convex side of each tooth were from two to four pits about one third
of an inch in diameter, and the same in depth, in which gems had been
inserted. Two small pearls were still in place. Near by were the remains
of another necklace composed of alternate pearls and bone
beads; the latter were oblong and perforated lengthwise. Eight of
the pearls were recovered, ranging in diameter from one half to one
third of an inch, and pierced through the center, but all were very
badly injured by the action of fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. David I. Bushnell, who has excavated the McEvers mound in
Montezuma, Pike County, Illinois, for the Missouri Historical Society,
found in this mound a cyst containing a skeleton six feet in height and
also a skull reposing on a bundle of bones near which lay forty-five
pearls, one of them weighing fifty-two grains and still showing a
beautiful luster. Almost all the objects discovered in the mound will
be presented to the Missouri Historical Society. The large pearl
would be worth from $12,000 to $15,000 if it were in perfect condition.</p>

<p class='c013'>We learn from Mr. Richard Herrmann, founder of the Herrmann
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>Museum of Natural History, Dubuque, Iowa, that on the top of the
high cliff from Eagle’s Point to its end at McKnight’s Spring, there
were formerly a great many mounds which were long ago examined
by government experts. Many ancient ornaments were found in
these mounds, among them a string of pearls, greatly damaged from
having been buried for a long period.<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c017'><sup>[561]</sup></a> Mr. Herrmann believes that
these pearls were taken from the Mississippi River by the mound-builders.</p>

<p class='c013'>Enough has been said, in this general sketch, to give some idea of
the extent to which pearls, largely those from the fresh-water Unios,
were gathered and used by the native tribes of North America, from
the ancient mound-builders of the Ohio Valley to the Indians encountered
by the explorers and colonists of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p>

<p class='c013'>The love of pearls shown by the Indians was as noteworthy as was
their devotion to their dead and the superstitious mystery which enshrouds
their funeral rites; for, when the human sacrifice was consummated,
the act was performed in as earnest a spirit of devotion as was
shown by Abraham in his readiness to sacrifice Isaac, and the Indians
evidenced an almost pathetic sentiment either of reverence, duty, or
supernatural dread.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. J. Walter Fewkes writes that in none of his excavations has he
ever noted pearls. Haliotis shells, conch shells, and fragments of the
same have been found in the great ruins at Casa Grande, Arizona.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Charles Hercules Read, director of the Department of Archæology
of the British Museum, states that the Mexican mosaic masks
in the Christy collection, which are pre-Columbian in origin, and probably
date hundreds of years in advance of the conquest, prove of special
interest from the fact that five of them contain an inlay of mother-of-pearl
shell. The first of these is a plain mask in which the eyes are
of mother-of-pearl; the second is a dagger having the details of
feather-work in mother-of-pearl; the third, a circular shield center
having the eyes, teeth, fingers, and toes of the figures in mother-of-pearl;
the fourth, a helmet with small pieces of pearl-shell representing
collars around the necks of rattlesnakes; and the fifth is a jaguar in
the side of which are similar inlays. These masks are described by
Dr. Read in “Archæologia,” Society of Antiquaries, London, Vol. LIV,
p. 383; in this volume the objects are shown in color. Dr. Read communicates
that the pearl jaguar seems to be of more recent execution,
but he believes the first four to be original. He is not entirely sure
that these objects contain the true mother-of-pearl, the substance having
changed so much as to make a decision doubtful even if it were
extracted. He states, however, that it is a pearly, nacreous shell, resembling
that of the ordinary pearl-oyster. In these masks are also
other shells, among them a red shell, probably a spondylus, almost as
red as coral. The mother-of-pearl is of special interest as it is quite
possible that the shell itself was known, and it may be that pearls also
formed part of a commerce that existed between the coast and the interior.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>We are informed by Mr. E. P. Dieseldorf, of Coban, Republic of
Guatemala, that he has never observed pearls in the pre-Columbian
graves in Guatemala; he had, however, frequently found marine
shells, whole, and elaborated in connection with jadeite beads.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a personal communication, Mr. Thomas Gann, of Yucatan, states
that, in excavating a mound at San Antonio, near the mouth of the
Rio Hondo, in Yucatan, he uncovered a small stone cyst or chamber,
containing two perforated, pear-like ornaments of considerable size,
together with portions of a human skeleton, painted pottery, etc. He
also states that ornaments such as beads, gorgets, and ear-pendants,
made from the pearly shell of both the oyster and the conch,
are of common occurrence in many sepulchral mounds in British Honduras
and in Yucatan, and he notes the fact that pink conch pearls
are found in considerable numbers at the present day along the coast
of British Honduras. There is no especial fishing for pearls,
and they are found only incidentally in conchs which have been
gathered for food. These pearls are sold by fishermen in Balize at
prices varying from two or three dollars to twenty or thirty apiece.
In size they range from that of a large pin’s head to that of a small
pea.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Marie Robinson Wright informs us that she has never found
pearls in the Bolivian graves, although they are quite plentiful in Bolivia
to-day, and hundreds of them are offered in the markets. The
pretty girls wear them as earrings and in their <i>topos</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is no doubt that pearls existed long before the advent of man,
both in the fresh-water and in the marine form. This is more clearly
evidenced by Sir Charles Lyell, who calls attention to the fact that the
fresh-water mussel (<i>Unio littoralis Gray</i>), formerly found in abundance
at Grays Thurrock, Essex, no longer exists in England, but
occurs in France, showing that not only had this mollusk been unseen
by any Englishman, but that the form had become extinct in an entire
country. Thus, both the pearl shell of the ocean and the pearl-mussel
of the river, for many centuries produced pearls, which passed away
with the shell itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>A great number of fossil Unios were collected by Barnum Brown
from the Laramie clays, 130 miles northwest of Miles City, Montana.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>The shells were found in a bed situated about 180 feet above the
Fort Pierre shales and, therefore, well above the recognized cretaceous
strata. These shells were in fairly good condition and retained the
nacreous coloring to a considerable extent. As some of them resemble
the modern species, it seems that the same designations might be
applied to them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Prof. R. P. Whitfield, one of our greatest palæontologists, who
has carefully examined these fossil shells, suggests that they are probably
the progenitors of the species of Unios and fresh-water mussels
that now inhabit the Mississippi and Wisconsin rivers and their tributaries,
and he proposes the following names for some of them, indicating
at the same time the living species with which he compares
them: <i>Unio biæsopoides</i>, <i>Unio æsopoides</i> and <i>Unio æsopiformis</i>, all
resembling <i>U. æsopus</i> Green; <i>Unio letsoni</i> = <i>U. cornutus</i> Barnes; <i>Unio
cylindricoides</i> = <i>U. cylindricus</i> Say; <i>Unio gibbosoides</i> = <i>U. gibbosus</i>
Barnes; <i>Unio pyramidatoides</i> = <i>U. pyramidatus</i> Lea; <i>Unio retusoides</i> =
<i>U. retusus</i> Lam.; <i>Unio verucosiformis</i> = <i>U. verrucosus</i> Barnes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Although it is almost certain that these ancient Unios were pearl-bearing,
Professor Whitfield informs us that, in a period of fifty
years of palæontological research, he has never found a fossil pearl.</p>

<p class='c013'>We are informed by Sophus Müller, Director of the Royal Danish
Museum of Antiquities at Copenhagen, that no Danish ornaments
containing pearls have been found dating from an earlier period than
1000 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>; he also states that no fresh-water pearls have ever been discovered
in the Danish graves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. H. Ulmann, director of the great Swiss Landesmuseum at
Zurich, and Dr. Otto Leiner, director of the Rosengarten Museum at
Constance, personally communicated to us that no pearls exist in either
of the collections of these great museums, nor to their knowledge have
any been discovered in the lake-dwellings or the prehistoric graves
of either Switzerland or Baden. This may either be due to conditions
favorable to the dissolution of the pearl by the action of the ooze on
the lake bottom, or else to the entire absence of knowledge of them on
the part of a people who were familiar with many materials, since the
museum collections even show jade implements of a number of types.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Leiner, whose father was curator of the Rosengarten Museum
before him, informs us that at Bodman on Lake Constance there were
found a large number of bored cylinders, from one fourth of an inch
to one inch in length, made out of limestone. They were used for
necklaces, somewhat in the style of our Indian wampum, and were
either worn alone or in connection with bored cylinders made of the
tuff-rock and also of encrinite stems.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Leiner also asserts that he has never seen <i>Unio margaritifera</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>in Lake Constance; nor was there any evidence of shells, broken
or otherwise, observed by him in the excavations in the lake-dwellings.</p>

<p class='c013'>The curator of the Rhodesia Museum, Bulawayo, South Africa,
states that in Rhodesia, in the vicinity of Bulawayo, beads made out of
the shell of the common Unio or fresh-water mussel (<i>Unio verreauxi</i>)
have been observed in the graves, although pearls themselves have
never been found with them in any burials.</p>

<h3 class='c031'>ADDENDA</h3>

<p class='c038'>One of the authors used every endeavor in 1893 and 1894 to have a bill
passed by Congress for the regulation of pearl-fishing in the United States.
These efforts were frustrated by the influence of the local pearl fishers. An
attempt has now been made to preserve the industry in Illinois, where the
legislature has this spring passed a bill for its regulation.</p>

<p class='c020'>The first section of the bill provides:</p>

<p class='c020'>It shall be unlawful for any person or persons to take or catch, by any means
whatever, in any of the navigable waters within the jurisdiction of this State, any
mussel, fresh-water clam or shell-fish from the first day of October to the first
day of April (both dates inclusive) of each succeeding year.</p>

<p class='c013'>The bill imposes upon any one who violates these provisions a fine of not
less than $25, nor more than $100, or imprisonment in the county jail for a
term not exceeding one year, or else both fine and imprisonment at the discretion
of the court.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another section provides that any one not a resident of Illinois, who takes
clams, shell-fish, or mussels, without procuring a license, shall be subject to a
fine of not less than $50, nor more than $100, or to imprisonment for one
year, or to both penalties. The licenses may be procured on application and
payment of $50 for each vessel to be employed, and they expire on the first
day of October following their issuance. The amount received for these licenses
is to be turned over to the State Treasurer at the end of each month
and placed to the credit of the State Fish Protective Fund. No boat having
more than two bars, each not exceeding sixteen feet in length, shall be used
for this fishery, and the space separating the hooks on these bars is not to be
less than eight inches.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Carl, the artist who painted the portraits of the Empress and that of
the Dowager Empress of China, states that she wears a diamond ring. When
she shows this she apologizes for wearing it, stating that it had been given to
her by the Viceroy, Li Hung Chang, saying that she, herself, sees no beauty
in the sparkle of the diamond; for her there is more beauty in the soft, quiet
tones of the pearl than in the brilliancy of the diamond.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the Boxer War in China, the looting was carried on to so great an
extent, that a French hotel-keeper is said to have obtained a basket of pearls,
which he bought for a trifle, and which are said to have netted him very nearly
$1,000,000.</p>

on the American coast, and especially
at Cubagua on the present coast of Venezuela,
also reported very lengthy stays. In 1526,
Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdés
wrote: “The thing that causeth men most
to marvel is to consider how many of them
can remain at the bottom for the space of one
whole hour, and some more or less, according
to expertness.” (“Natural Historia de
las Indias,” Toledo, 1526.) About 1588, the
Jesuit priest José de Acosta wrote: “I did
see them make their fishing, the which is
done with great charge and labor of the poor
slaves, which dive 6, 7, yea 12 fathoms into
the sea...; but yet the labor and toil is
greatest in holding their breath, sometimes a
quarter, yea, half an hour together under
water.” (Acosta, “Natural and Moral History
of the Indies,” Hakluyt Society, 1880,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
